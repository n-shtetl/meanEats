# author_id: 1,
# kicker: "Maximize your range's cooking capacity with a stovetop griddle.",
# body: "Of all the restaurant kitchen equipment and appliances that I miss working with on a daily basis, a French top range is high on my list, especially when I'm cooking a number of things at once on my stovetop. A French top has a large flat surface made of cast iron or rolled steel, with a couple of rings positioned in the center. Underneath those central rings is a high-powered gas burner that heats the cooking surface in a radiant fashion; as we already know, cast iron is a poor conductor of heat, so the cooking surface is hottest at the center, and as you move away from the rings it becomes less intense.\nThe graduated heat of a French top allows you to sauté, simmer, and warm food all at the same time, without having to fiddle with the knobs of your burners. Simply slide your pots and pans around on the flat-top to find the perfect area for cooking, like Sohla's famous duck zone. The large flat surface of a French top also allows you to fit a lot more cookware on the range than you can on regular home ranges—no matter whether you are working with gas, electric, or induction—which generally only allow you to fit four to six vessels over the heating elements on the stovetop.\nYou may be thinking, \"Great, thanks. That's super useful information for when I stumble upon an extra ten grand to buy a fancy stove.\" But I'm not here to give you a home-improvement sales pitch; rather, I'd like to share a little trick for MacGyver-ing a bootleg French top on a regular stove. As with my chimney starter grilling set-up and foil-lined brick rig for better skewers, I'm always looking for cooking workarounds that use equipment I already have. This time, I'm using a Baking Steel (or cast iron griddle) to make a jury-rigged French top.\nThe Baking Steel is already one of our favorite pieces of equipment for pizza-making at home, and doubles as a high-performance stovetop griddle. With its thick, heavy-gauge steel construction and high volumetric heat capacity, the Baking Steel always reminded me of a French top cooking surface, so I started experimenting with it as a flat-top in the test kitchen.\nI'm happy to report it works like a dream—perfect for keeping food simmering or warm in a number of saucepans and pots, while also getting hot enough to sauté, reduce, and sear at high heat in a skillet. If you find that your stovetop often turns into a frustrating game of saucepan Tetris when cooking and re-heating food for a holiday meal, then I highly recommend busting out a cast iron griddle or Baking Steel if you have one. (Do note, though, that many stovetop griddles have a raised rim that will limit how many pans you can fit; the entirely flat surface of the Baking Steel griddle allows pans to come right up to the edge while sitting flat.)\nAs you probably have experienced, simmering, re-heating, and holding food at a consistent temperature is very difficult to do on your stovetop (it's one of the primary advantages of sous vide cooking). You end up having to constantly adjust the heat on your burners. And then there's the issue of space. At home, I have a small four-burner gas range that emits pretty weak flames all-around. With that setup, I can only fit four cooking vessels at a time, and even then, I have to maneuver them so that they all can fit at once—two large pots or skillets can't be on adjacent front and back burners. It's a cooking Rubik's cube.But when I pop a Baking Steel griddle over two of the burners on my stove, I open up a lot more space for cooking and heating food. I can adjust how I heat the Baking Steel, and which burners I use, depending on the kitchen tasks I need to get done. This is especially helpful when cooking large meals for holidays like Thanksgiving.\nIf I want to cook a few things at a simmer, like sides of braised kale and purple cabbage, along with a batch of cranberry sauce and gravy, I heat the burners under the Baking Steel to medium and fit all the pots and saucepans on the same heated surface. This also reduces the risk of scorching the food that's being cooked, as the heat is more evenly distributed through the Baking Steel than it would be with a pan sitting directly over a burner flame. You therefore don't have to babysit at the stove as much, and you can focus on other kitchen prep.\nIf I need different heat levels on different parts of the cooking surface, I can do that too. Let's say that I have just one dish that starts with sweating shallots in oil over higher heat. To do that, I bring that pan to the front area of the Baking Steel, and crank up the heat of the burner directly under it. While that's happening the back burner can be set to a lower heat for simmering, or turned off completely to let the heat gently radiate through the Baking Steel from the front burner, mimicking the graduated heat on a French top.\nThe flat-top cooking surface that you create with the stovetop griddle makes it easier to get the even heat of the \"duck zone,\" and provides a smoother surface for swirling a pan when you're finishing and tossing pasta, or building a butter emulsion for glazed carrots (it's also easier on the ears, since the sound of a skillet dragged over the grate of a gas burner can be like nails on a chalkboard).\nAlong with giving you a larger cooking surface, a Baking Steel makes for a great warming station for those big holiday meals. Getting all the food you made hot again is always a headache. The oven is inevitably tied up, and you don't want to be constantly zapping things in the microwave or transferring everything to and from plastic bags to reheat with an immersion circulator. The Baking Steel stovetop setup allows you to heat up and hold a lot of food in a number of different pans all at once, while keeping it in sight and therefore front-of-mind (how many times have you forgotten something being reheated in an oven?).\nBecause the Baking Steel and other griddles aren't large enough to cover all four burners on even my small range, you still have a couple free ones to use if there are more projects that you need to get done on the stove. With this DIY French top, you can fit a lot more cookware on your range and get a lot more done. Dream kitchens are great and all, but we can all enjoy the benefits of getting creative with the equipment we have.\n")

# author_id: 1,
# kicker: 'A writer gets a rare glimpse into how her favorite Mexican specialty is made.',
# body: "Against the world's greatest delicacies, Hidalgo-style barbacoa holds its own. The whole lamb cooks overnight in its own juices, wrapped in agave leaves over a low fire, and emerges sticky with fat and imbued with smoke from the wood coals and lightly charred leaves, ready to be shredded and wrapped in warm tortillas for hungry eaters.\nI first fell in love with the meltingly tender meat in a small town outside of Querétaro, Mexico. In the 15 years since, finding the best barbacoa has been something of a mission for me. I’ve returned to San Juan del Río, where I first found it, and explored the sprawling metropolis of Mexico City and its environs, expressly for the dish. I've even sought it out around the US, in Seattle, in Austin, and in Los Angeles.\nBut the actual mechanics of cooking it were a bit of a mystery to me until the family behind Barbacoa Renatos, which some claim serves the best barbacoa in Mexico City—and which is one of the few small venues where the pit-cooked lamb is made on-site, rather than cooked in neighboring Hidalgo or México state and brought into the city—invited me to observe their three-day process, culminating on Sunday, when barbacoa is traditionally served.\nThe origins of pit-cooking meat trace back to the Taíno people in the Caribbean, during the pre-Columbian era, but the technique migrated west to central Mexico, leaving a trail of underground ovens, like the pibils in the eastern part of the country. The word barbacoa is thought to come from an indigenous word meaning \"framework of sticks\" or \"sacred firepit,\" though some say it came from the Spanish phrase de la barba a la cola, or \"from the beard to the tail.\"\nAccording to the book Pre-Hispanic Mexican Cuisine: The Food of the Ancient Mexicans, which Barbacoa Renatos has used as a source, the Mayans came up with the technique of steam-cooking meat in underground ovens, which keeps both the juices from the animal and the smoke and heat from escaping and forces them back into the meat, resulting in big flavor and preventing any drying out. The method was in use at the time of the Spanish arrival in Mexico, and little about it has changed in the centuries since. Renato, Adriana, and Bruno Álvarez Cruz, the siblings in charge of running Renatos today, say that their specific technique for making barbacoa has been passed down for at least three generations.\nI arrive at Renatos on Saturday, the second of three days of preparation. On Friday, Adriana went to the meat vendor at 3 a.m. to pick out lambs at the butcher shop. If she were to arrive any later, the best lambs—small, tender, barely a year of age, brought in from ranches in Veracruz or Hidalgo state—would all be long gone.\nUntil recently, shopping for the lamb and other ingredients was done by her father, Renato Álvarez Rentería, who learned the art of barbacoa from his father, Alejandro Álvarez Solano. Fifty-eight years and three generations later—four when Adriana’s 11-year-old son, Javier, helps out—barbacoa remains the family business. This spring, the elder Renato had some serious health issues, requiring his children and their spouses to step in and take over.\nWhen Adriana returned home with the lambs on Friday, they were salted and left to cure overnight. By the time I arrive at 8:30 Saturday morning, Renato is focused on starting the fire in the hoyo, or pit oven: a large square of brick and cement, rising about two feet from the ground floor of the Álvarez home, with a circular, brick-lined well descending another four or so feet belowground. A thick layer of black soot covers the adjacent walls, climbing past the two floors that make up the family's living space and up to the ceiling.\nStanding atop the still-warm coals from last week, resting his head on the shoulder-level top of the oven in the center of his house, Renato says a silent prayer. \"I’m asking that it goes well,\" he tells me, before lighting the fire of pine and eucalyptus wood. It's my first hint that what I'd always considered a sacred Sunday ritual for food lovers like myself has its own spiritual side.\nOnce the fire is roaring and flames are whipping out of the top of the oven, Renato turns to the meat: about three and a half lambs, broken into nine pieces each. Their standard order used to be five lambs, but, as Adriana tells me, with gas prices rising and uncertainty over the upcoming presidential election leading some customers to rein in their spending habits, they’ve cut back.\nAt 9:30 on Saturday morning, as Renato soaks the lamb for 20 minutes to remove the salt, it seems so far—and will for most of the weekend—that 90% of making barbacoa is cleaning. First, the entire bottom floor and entrance to the house is scrubbed. By the time the first of the 300 or so customers comes in on Sunday morning, each piece of lamb after its desalination soak, each vegetable and fruit for salsas and drinks, along with every pot, pan, and table, will have been washed over and over.\nThat includes the palenques, the tall, slender leaves of the maguey plant, which fold into a packet to hold the meat when it goes into the oven. After cleaning, Renato and one of the restaurant's employees, Ana, lay the leaves on a piece of hot metal over the still-orange flames of the fire to soften them and add a bit of charring flavor. They look for the leaves of older plants for width and length, so they can use fewer of them and fold them over the meat more easily. The maguey leaves impart some of their own flavor—usually described as rich or caramel-like—and function to keep many of the lamb's own juices in.\nOver a breakfast of chilaquiles and tostadas de tinga washed down with sweet, weak coffee, I learn more about the business’s past. Adriana and Renato’s mother, María Eugenia Cruz Guzman, now retired, tells her own barbacoa history.\n\"I was pura borrega myself,\" she laughs, comparing herself to the young lambs they cook. At age 17, while selling chickens at the local market, she met the elder Renato, shopping for his family’s barbacoa business, and they got married. At the time, 46 years ago, \“everything was artisanal, everything was done completely by hand,\” she says. The process took many more days and included burning the hair off the legs of lamb and cleaning the spikes from the giant nopal (cactus) leaves that come on the garnish plate—tasks now done by the vendors.\nTen years after marrying, they moved to the current house. Until recently, she and her husband did all of the barbacoa work while Adriana and Bruno had other jobs—Renato still does, as a history teacher at a secondary school. When she cooked, Renato tells me, I could never have gotten this insider glimpse: \“She wouldn’t let anyone from outside the family in, because if she did, the fire would get angry and leave the meat raw.\” It was starting to become clearer to me why, despite my long-held love of the meat, I'd never fully understood the process.\nLooking into the hellmouth of an oven, it seems hard to believe anything could exit raw. As we wait for the flames to change from red or orange to blue—\“We go only by our eyes,\” he says, \“never by temperature\”—Renato begins the final preparation of the meat with a last sprinkling of salt.\nHe sets a large, round metal cage on a folding table, then folds each of the five-foot-tall maguey leaves into the cage so they poke out from its center and climb the side, splaying them out at the top. Inside this lining of palenques, he carefully places the lamb, all the pieces except the ribs, which he’ll set on top. The lamb, mostly in a single layer, takes up about two-thirds of the pot. A few avocado leaves go in for additional flavor.\nIn the remaining space, Renato adds the contents of a yellow bucket labeled panza—which translates to \"belly,\" though the bucket actually contains finely chopped and marinated lamb heart, lungs, and intestine, stuffed into a pair of lamb stomachs. Poking holes in the stomach with a sharp knife so it doesn’t balloon up and explode, he then covers it all with caul fat to keep it from drying out.\nWhen all is arranged, he bends the leaves, previously folded back over the edge of the cage, gently over the top, then stabs a series of butter knives through them to form a stable, prettily wrapped package. He hooks the cage into what looks like a medieval torture device, but is in fact a pulley system with four chains that attach to the side, allowing one person to maneuver the heavy cage of meat alone. The contraption, fixed to a metal track on the ceiling, is only about three years old, part of efficiency improvements that helped bring the entire barbacoa preparation process down from four to three days. Bruno, Adriana and Renato’s brother, wrote a graduate-school thesis on streamlining the business, and the family put many of his ideas into place.\nAt 1:15 in the afternoon, almost five hours after he started building the fire, Renato declares the flames blue, and thus ready. He uses a long-handled shovel to pull out the still-flaming chunks of eucalyptus wood, whose burning characteristics were desired for the fire but whose smell would change the flavor of the meat. As he flings fragrant fireballs up from the inferno, Ana douses them with water, and a hiss echoes around the room, momentarily drowning out the music coming from his phone.\nUsing a rope woven under two handles, he and Ana carefully lower the pot of ingredients for the consomé—a soup flavored with barbacoa drippings and lamb feet—onto the coals at the bottom, then add water from huge multi-gallon jugs. The metal cage with the meat in it goes down next, via its pulley-chain device. By the time the lamb pouch reaches the bottom, the intense heat of the oven has already brought the consomé to a boil.\n
# The pair line the top edge of the oven with wet newspaper, put on the oven’s metal cover, then add more newspaper on top, followed by a thick layer of dirt and sand that holds the heat in. A plastic tarp goes over it all, and the day’s work, aside from a little more cleanup, is done.The next day, work starts again at 5 a.m. Formerly housing a maze of stacked tables and chairs, plus parking space for a motorcycle, the front of the ground floor is transformed into a dining room. Renato pulls the plastic tarp off the oven, and wisps of smoke seep through the dirt and rise to the ceiling. He shovels the dirt carefully, returning it to the wall-mounted metal containers from which it came. Then the newspaper is gathered up and stored in a crate for use again next week.\nUsing a rope, Renato works with Adriana’s husband, Javier Sr., to pull the meat up a few feet. The green palenques have warmed over to a soft and murky brown; the knives that once stood erect to sharply seal them are now atilt and loosely hanging on. Javier straddles the oven and deftly swipes open the leaves with a knife, pulling out a few nibbles of the barbacoa. The air fills with the gentle but all-encompassing aroma of long-cooked lamb. A square table is placed into the oven, then the meat set on top of it. Now that the meat is raised a few feet from the floor of the oven, it can easily be reached during service while it’s still warm, even once the oven is covered.\nJavier hands me a red plastic plate with the pile of meat he retrieved. I taste it, surprised at the magic achieved by a night in the oven. It's the same as other barbacoa I've had, but better—slippery with its own juices, sticky with fat, rich, smoky, and beguiling. I taste every hour of its time in the oven, every minute of Renato's fire-lighting, every second of Adriana's early-morning shopping.\nThe rest of the team shows up: a waitress and two assistants, a tortilla-maker, two salsa-makers, and a dishwasher, all of whom assist the family on Sundays. Besides the traditional red and green salsas, they’ll make salsa borracha—a condiment that earns its \“drunk\” name from the pulque (a pre-Hispanic alcoholic beverage made from the fermented liquid of the agave plant) that gets mixed with pasilla chilies, fried onions, garlic, pepper, and oregano—and guacamole, which includes pipicha, a new-to-me twiggy herb with the brightness of mint but the complexity of cilantro. \“Barbacoa is strong,\” Renato explains. \“Everything else is designed to temper it.\”\nWhile the sauces come together and the still-warm fresh masa (corn dough), delivered that morning, is mixed with water to make tortillas, I join the father and son Javiers for a shopping excursion. \“Normally he joined his grandfather for this,\” says the elder Javier of his son. Now, with the elder Renato in the hospital, the younger Javier guides his father to find the last-minute pre-service items.\nFirst, they head to a market for flowers to decorate the tables, where the woman knows the order and asks after her ailing customer. Inside, another lady produces crushed ice by feeding a giant frozen block through an ancient-looking machine; Renatos will use the ice under the salsas to keep them cold through service. Then on to a bakery, for various pastries and the bolillos (rolls).\nJavier stops the minivan at a lonely-seeming bucket of hot lard, tucked into the side of a roundabout. A man runs up, and Javier asks for the chicharrones, which get fried to order. The vendor uses a set of tongs in each hand, deftly plunging them into the boiling fat, to unfurl the cooking pork skin. While it bubbles and pops, the younger Javier runs across the street for tamales, which will be stuffed into the bolillos as hearty sandwiches (tortas de tamal) for the team before service.\nAt 8:30 a.m., the team gathers for a quick meeting to go over reservations, flavors, and specials, and to scarf down the tamale sandwiches with mugs of coffee before the doors open. The first customer walks in 15 minutes later. Now, suddenly, like color filling in a black-and-white movie, the magic of the two previous days of work comes together into the familiar choreographed dance of restaurant service.\nAna pinches the edges of masa cakes into sopes and slaps blue-corn tortillas onto the grill. Elena, another of the workers, arranges salsas over ice for one station and into tiny bowls on a plate to send out to customers. Adriana hands out the leather-bound menu and takes orders, while Bruno consults with a customer looking to book a party. About US$26 buys a kilogram of barbacoa, $1.50 a bowl of consomé, and $3 a barbacoa taco or four fried barbacoa flautas. Many tables order the combination packages—for $30, you get four large consomés, half a kilo of meat, the upgraded garnish plate, four glasses of the day's aguas frescas, and 18 tortillas, enough to feed four people.\nEach time an order for barbacoa comes in, Renato removes the cover to the oven and leans into the hole, belly on the edge and head inside, shoveling meat onto a plate. Treasure unburied, he stands up and turns to his chopping station. An employee named Jorge jokes and teases the other employees as he washes dishes. Garnish plates, stacked high with pápalo, nopales, avocado, and chicharrones, head out of the kitchen, met by bowls of consomé, tacos, sopes, flautas, and tortillas filled with cheese and barbacoa, called quesacoas.\nI eat through the menu, reflecting on the process as I watch customers come in. I wonder how many of them understand that they're sitting in the basement of a family home, eating the product of four generations of experience, of three days of labor. I wonder whether they can taste, amid savory bites of taco, that making barbacoa is a ritual.\nLater, friends will ask if I'm convinced that it's the best in the city. I haven't tried all the barbacoa that's out there, an impossible feat in a city with tens of millions of people. But Renatos has at least ended my search for the best—now, I head straight there when I'm in town.\nA table of nine comes in, and the place seems lively. But Adriana disagrees, telling me it’s a slow start for them. Both she and Renato, separately, confess a little worry about the business. For the month that their father has been ill, the events—parties, baptisms, weddings—that usually happen in this space on Saturdays have all been canceled. In addition to her father’s health concerns and the country's state of flux ahead of the election, the barbacoa business has the usual problems that accompany making traditional food in a modern world. \“It’s hard now,\” she says, \“because there’s so much competition.\” Fast food restaurants, malls, and markets are all over.\nThey’re down to selling only 40 to 50 cooked kilos of meat (about 80 to 90 kilos raw) per week, at a business that, her mother says, once did five times that. Renato shrugs. What will happen to the business, this family tradition making its way down to a fourth generation, is up in the air as its patriarch ails. It is a decision he, Adriana, Bruno, and another brother who currently lives in Cancún will need to make. \"In this economy,\" he says, \"simple things can break a business.\"\nBut in nearly the same breath as each expresses concern, they dive, wholeheartedly and often whole-bodily, into the making of barbacoa, as did their parents and their grandparents before them. The oven, its bricks and cement and trails of soot dusting the walls above it, forms the center of the family home, and so too, on a less tangible level, does the weekend task of making barbacoa. Economies have ups and downs, but the Álvarez Cruz family blood seems to run with the juice of lamb, cooked low, slow, and in an oven built by their father’s hands.\n")

# author_id: 1,
# kicker: "A celebration of Robert Burns, Scots, and all things Scottish",
# body: "Every year, as January 25 draws closer, all across Scotland—and throughout the highly enthusiastic Scottish diaspora—people begin ironing their flashes, tucking their sgian-dubhs into their socks, and choosing between their formal and informal tartans in anticipation of Burns Night, the haggis- and whisky-fueled celebration of the birth of the poet Robert \"Rabbie\" Burns, and all things Bonnie and Scottish.\nBack in 1759, when Burns was born to a farming family in Ayrshire, Scottish-ness was not something that could be celebrated quite so effusively. It had been 52 years since the Act of Union brought Scotland into the \"English\" fold as part of a United Kingdom, and only 14 years since the Jacobites, led by Bonnie Prince Charlie, invaded England and were defeated at the Battle of Culloden. The English took a dim view of the Scots invading from the north, and retaliated by breaking up the Highland clans, and even banned kilts in an effort to curtail symbols of patriotism.\nBurns was something of a literary rebel, with his steadfast commitment to writing in Scots dialect and his passion for collecting and publishing local folk songs and ballads. His undaunted spirit of Scottish nationalism is what makes Burns Night, from the Glens of the Highlands, to the Lochs of the Trossachs, to the rocky shores of the Hebridean Isles (where my in-laws live), the party of the year.\nThe first official Burns Night wasn't celebrated in January. Rather, history tells of a commemorative dinner held in Burns's honor in the summer of 1801, five years after his death. Then, in 1802, some of his friends threw the first of what they planned to be an annual supper party on his birthday, which they thought was January 29. The following year someone thought to just double check the date with Ayr Parish Church’s birth records, and the party date was adjusted to January 25.\n\"Up here in our wee village, tickets sold out before Christmas,\" says Liz, a Burns Night aficionado famed for her clootie dumpling. \"It’s incredibly popular. We have the party in the hall, but you might have it in the church, or at someone’s house if it’s big enough, it doesnea matter.\" My in-laws infamously hosted Burns Night one year in their barn, with an accompanying bonfire so large that the local fire brigade came to investigate.\nIn spite of its raucous reputation—a reputation of which Burns, who loved wine, women, and song, would have heartily approved—Burns Night is pretty much the definition of organized fun. There’s nothing spontaneous at all about a gathering that follows an official Standard Order, including regulated bagpiping (the best kind), poetry, recitation, and formal toasts. Luckily, there’s also always a lot of whisky, so everything gets fun fast, and only gets better as the night goes on.\nProceedings kick off with a piper, who pipes in the guests. For Hector, who owns both a fur sporran (a small purse that hangs over the kilt in the manner of a fanny pack) and a set of bagpipes, this is his moment to shine. \"The rest of the year they all moan about me practicing, but on Burns Night I’m a hero!\"\nPost-piping, the host welcomes the guests, and someone stands up to give the Selkirk Grace, so called because Burns gave it at a party held by the Earl of Selkirk. The grace was my husband Jonathan’s first formal participation in Burns Night, at a school party. At age nine, all rucked up in his brother’s hand-me-down kilt, he was made to recite in his best and broadest Scots: \"Some hae meat an canna eat, / And some wad eat that want it; / But we hae meat, and we can eat, / And sae the Lord be thankit.\"\nWith the prospect of meat in the offing, and thankfulness all round, the drinking of whisky begins. (\“Not at the school party, obviously\" Jonathan’s quick to clarify, \"though we were allowed Irn Bru, which was a big win.\") And so, piped, poem-ed, blessed, and toasted, it’s time to eat.\nThe first course at a Burns Night Supper is usually soup. Scotch broth if you’re being traditional, sweet with barley and lamb; potato soup if everyone’s going to be hitting the whisky hard; a creamy bowl of Cullen skink with plenty of finnan haddie (smoked haddock) if you’re a wee bit fancy; or cock-a-leekie if you want to honor the (semi) official soup of Scotland, happen to have a lot of leeks in your vegetable patch, or you just like saying cock-a-leekie, and who could blame you?\nAll this is mere anticipation-building to the main event of the supper, the haggis, which is piped in, brought round the table for everyone to admire, sliced with great ceremony (and, sometimes, a great saber) and served with neeps (turnips) and tatties (potatoes), but not before it’s been addressed with eight stanzas of Burn’s most famous poem, \"Address to a Haggis\":\nFair fa' your honest, sonsie [beautiful] face,\nGreat chieftain o' the puddin-race!\nAboon them a' ye tak your place,\nPainch [stomach], tripe, or thairm [intestine]:\nWeel are ye wordy o' a grace\nAs lang's my airm.\nHaggis is a savory pudding made from minced sheep’s heart, liver, and lungs, mixed with onion, suet, stock, pepper, and blood, all stirred through with oatmeal to give it bulk. The mixture is then stuffed into a stomach and poached until tender (or, if you’re in a Glaswegian chippy, battered and deep fried). When the casing is sliced, the innards spill out, dark and red, a moment celebrated by the poem’s most famous (and, arguably, least appetizing) couplet:\nAnd then, O what a glorious sight,\nWarm-reekin, rich!\nHaving laid down a strong foundation of food, the drinking portion of the evening begins in earnest with a series of toasts. The first of these is the Toast To The Lassies, which originated as a heartfelt thank you to the cooks, but is now a ribald rhyming thesis about women in general. It’s followed by a rebuttal Toast To The Lads. Both the toasts are prepared beforehand by guests, and should be a) rhyming and b) funny. One year Liz (mother of Jonathan’s childhood best friend Christopher) was in charge of the Toast To The Lads. Much to the surprise of the children, she apparently aired a lot of opinions about what men were and were not good for. \“Did I?,\” she says, now. \“Och, I don’t really remember! Well, maybe I said that in bed men were good for warming your toes on! Something like that? I don’t think it was a very rude toast, but ah well, you never know.\”\nDessert follows; maybe clootie dumpling, a rich, boiled fruit cake, (according to Jonathan, Liz’s version is especially good; \“pure Barry,\” apparently) maybe cranachan, a trifle-like pudding made with whisky soaked oats, honey, and whipped cream. But everyone knows dessert is just the calm before the storm. By the time plates of oatcakes and cheese have been passed around the drummer and fiddler will have set up in the corner, and the accordion player will be will hauling in his instrument from the trunk of the car. It’s time for the Ceilidh to begin.\nDashing men in kilts—and not so dashing men in kilts—leap heartily into \"Strip The Willow,\" \"The Dashing White Sergeant,\" and \"The Gay Gordons,\" leaving chaos in their wake. \"We went to a party one year, out in the wilds in the middle of nowhere in this wee village country hall,\" Liz recalls. \"It was absolutely mad. They do all the dances double time, so it was killing! You normally go ‘heel, toe, 1, 2, 3,’ fairly slowly, but they were hauling about! It was absolutely knackering!\"\nGenerations of Scots hit the dance floor to birl and reel about, with daggers stuffed down their socks, which is apparently fine because it’s traditional. This is the point in the evening when my brother-in-law Timothy once stabbed himself in the eye with his thistle boutonnière and ended the night in the hospital; it is when I was once whisked around so vigorously in the refined setting of the Edinburgh Assembly Rooms that my stiletto (rookie mistake) flew off and hit the fiddler.\nWhile the band takes a break, other entertainers have a chance to shine. Someone might recite a couple of short verses from the Burns classics \"To A Mouse\" or \"To A Louse,\" which, to be honest, were probably funnier back in the 18th century. Jonathan may (as he did as a teenager) even burst into an impromptu and unasked for rendition of \"Tam O’ Shanter.\" You never know. But you can be certain that more drinking will occur, and that the second set of dancing will be even more dangerous than the first.\nWith one last waltz, it’s time for the band to pack up and head out. Nothing stands between revelers and the road apart from a final sing-along of \"Auld Lang Syne\", (which Burns transcribed/wrote from a traditional ballad):\nShould auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind?\nShould auld acquaintance be forgot, and auld lang syne?\nBurns Night is over for another year. With warm Scottish (and Scottish-adjacent) hearts aglow, we head home through the cold winter’s night, exactly the way Burns would have wanted it.\n")

post5 = Post.create(id: i, title: "Not the Best Chicken Adobo (but Still Pretty Good)",
author_id: 1,
kicker: "A savory, vinegary chicken stew from the Philippines.",
body: "There are two truths about chicken adobo: Every Filipino family has its own recipe (and that recipe is definitely the best), and every chicken adobo tastes better the day after it's been cooked.\nAs a corollary to the first truth, I would add: Some non-Filipino families have their own recipes, too, although they're admittedly on much shakier ground with respect to claiming theirs as the best.\nCase in point: this recipe for chicken adobo, which is essentially the one my family has been cooking for about 35 years, ever since my parents cribbed it from my nanny, Erlinda, when we lived in the Philippines in the mid-1980s. It is, like all adobo recipes, salty and vinegary in almost equal measure, since the primary ingredients in most adobo recipes are soy sauce and vinegar. It's also incredibly easy to make, and, as such, has been in my regular weekly meal rotation for as long as I can remember.\nAdobo is uniquely Filipino, despite the fact that the word is Spanish and refers to dishes with some surface similarities in Mexico and Spain. But when used to refer to Filipino cuisine, it denotes both a cooking method—basically, a very acidic braise—and the class of dishes produced by that method.\nAs journalist and food historian Raymond Sokolov notes in his book Why We Eat What We Eat: How Columbus Changed the Way the World Eats, trying to demystify why Filipino dishes with clearly Spanish names somehow stand apart from other Spanish-inflected cuisines: \"For Filipino tamales, paella, and adobo, the cloak of names covers an indigenous reality.\" Essentially, Spanish colonizers arrived in the Philippines and described local dishes using their own language, so an acidic stewed dish came to be called \"adobo,\" despite the fact that the ingredients and the method were used long before the residents of the archipelago had ever even encountered Spanish people or culture.\nThat my American-Japanese household ate this regularly should come as no surprise to any Filipino, or, for that matter, any expatriate who's lived in the Philippines. As Amy Besa and Romy Dorotan write in Memories of Philippine Kitchens: Stories and Recipes From Far and Near, popular Filipino dishes, like adobo, lumpia (often cursorily described as Filipino spring rolls), and pancit (a noodle dish—also a cursory description that does not do it justice), represent the cuisine \"at its most accessible to the non-Filipino palate.\"\nSimilarly, Nicole Ponseca writes of adobo in I Am a Filipino: And This Is How We Cook, \"Who can resist the addictively sour, salty, garlicky classic adobo, which seemed to be the friendly bridge for many to connect with Filipinos?\" When my family moved to the Philippines in 1984, chicken adobo was an easy sell for my (white) American father, who, like all (white) American expats, preferred local dishes when they were made with chicken. For my Japanese mother, it was appealing because, well, soy sauce. Reductive-but-totally-accurate stereotypes aside, the dish was a hit, and it's been in the Spaeth household repertoire ever since.\nMy parents' recipe stayed pretty much the same over the years, and it was as simple as can be: Water, soy sauce, and vinegar were combined in a pot, along with some brown sugar, an enormous amount of garlic, whole black peppercorns, and several dried, dusty shards of bay leaf. Chicken legs, thighs, and wings were added to the pot, and the whole thing was simmered for about 45 minutes.\nAfter that, everything got refrigerated for dinner the next day, when the reheated adobo would be served with a big pile of super-garlicky and slightly oily fried rice—the greasiness of the rice tempers both the salinity and the acidity of the adobo sauce.\nSince leaving my parents' home, I've tinkered with their adobo recipe in small ways, and settled on a ratio of soy sauce to vinegar to water that my wife, my child, and I all prefer. I also ditched the brown sugar ages ago, because what I like best about adobo is its bracing, in-your-face quality, and I add more whole peppercorns, because I really enjoy chewing on them after they've been softened by the braise. Finally, I use fresh bay leaves instead of the dried stuff, and I always, always let it sit at least overnight in the fridge.\nGiven that the recipe I'll share with you has gone through decades of small changes, and has been passed down, now, through two generations (from Erlinda to my parents, and from my parents to me), I believe this recipe is, at the very least, authentic in spirit, if not authentic in fact, seeing as it's been devised by non-Filipino hands. I can say without reservation that it is a fine recipe for chicken adobo, although certainly not the best.\nTesting Browning\nThis site being what it is, I couldn't just write up the way I make chicken adobo. For one thing, I generally eyeball quantities and use my taste to guide me; for another, I make it differently almost every time, because adobo gives you options.\nSome days, I'd decide to make adobo because I was butchering a chicken for its breasts—making chicken piccata, say—and I had no plans for the legs. In that case, I'd split the legs into drums and thighs and dump them, along with the wings, in a pot with all the adobo elements, then simmer everything until the chicken was cooked. This makes a fine adobo, which I will eat happily every time, but even the most novice cook would be able to point out areas for improvement.\nOn other days, I'd take my time with the adobo, salting the chicken in advance, browning it thoroughly, and blooming the sliced garlic, whole peppercorns, and bay leaves in the rendered chicken fat. Then I'd use the braising liquid to deglaze the fond on the bottom of the pot, add back the browned chicken, and, again, simmer it until the chicken was done.\nAnd then there were days when, if the urge struck me, I'd take the chicken out of the braising liquid (doesn't matter which version, the browned or the un-browned); dry it off; and slide it under a broiler until the skin was a little charred and the meat was warmed through. I'd eat the chicken just like that, or serve it with garlic fried rice and a pool of the braising liquid as a sauce.\nI ended up testing all of these methods side by side. I made batches of chicken adobo in which the chicken pieces were never browned at any point. I made batches in which the garlic and spices were never bloomed in oil, and batches in which they were. I made batches in which the chicken was browned twice, both in the pot and under the broiler at the end. Based on all this, I can say with some confidence that chicken adobo any which way is delicious, and the method you choose has as much to do with personal preference as it does with how much time you have on your hands.\nI do want to take a moment to highlight what I think is the best part of chicken adobo, no matter how it's been cooked: the skin. Even if the chicken is un-browned when it goes in the pot, once it comes out, the skin is my favorite part. But I understand that many people in the US find the prospect of eating floppy braised chicken skin particularly unappealing.\nIf you, like me, actually like to eat chicken skin that's easier to slurp than to chew, I can wholeheartedly recommend going with the no-browning route. If you find that unappetizing, you'll have better success if you brown the chicken skin thoroughly first. Given that the vast majority of our readers will likely prefer it that way, I included a browning step in the attached recipe.\nIf you, like me, actually like to eat chicken skin that's easier to slurp than to chew, I can wholeheartedly recommend going with the no-browning route. If you find that unappetizing, you'll have better success if you brown the chicken skin thoroughly first. Given that the vast majority of our readers will likely prefer it that way, I included a browning step in the attached recipe.\nChicken wings adobo are almost an entirely different beast from the thighs and drums because of the way that the vinegary braising liquid transforms the collagen-rich cartilage and skin into a semisolid state. The wings, particularly the flats, are very fragile, and you have to be careful as you turn them while broiling, but the result is fall-apart-tender meat encased in semi-crispy, semisoft skin, punctuated by pops of extremely soft cartilage between your teeth.\nTesting Vinegars\nAs Besa and Dorotan note in Memories of Philippine Kitchens, \"Vinegar defines adobo.\" I believe my parents actually used Heinz distilled white vinegar for their adobo for many, many years, which means, I think, that their adobo was subpar by definition. Up until last year, I used distilled cane vinegar produced by the brand Datu Puti, which is owned by Philippine food company NutriAsia, but I stopped after reading news reports about the company's shoddy labor practices, which inspired a sustained strike by some of the company's workers in 2018. Since NutriAsia also owns the other major brand of distilled cane vinegar in the Philippines, Silver Swan, I decided to start using rice vinegar instead.\nIn developing this recipe, I tested it using a variety of vinegars: Heinz distilled white vinegar, Japanese rice vinegar (Mizkan), Bragg apple cider vinegar, and both Datu Puti and Silver Swan, tasting all of them side by side. Surprisingly, the only one I found a little odd was the batch made with apple cider vinegar; the rest tasted fine to me, although I preferred the Datu Puti and rice vinegar batches.\nBesa and Dorotan observe that they know of people who use balsamic vinegar in their adobo, and others who use coconut vinegar, and still others who use fruit vinegars of a wide variety. All of which is to say, most any vinegar will do, but for the purposes of our recipe I chose rice vinegar, since it is widely available and its production is associated with no (known) labor issues.\nDoes Adobo Really Get Better Overnight?\n
The claim that adobo gets better after resting overnight is one that seems to fly in the face of previous tests we've done on stews. But I did my best to test the claim, comparing a freshly made batch of adobo against one that had sat overnight in the refrigerator, and I can say without reservation that the batch that sat in the fridge overnight was better. How do we reconcile that with the tests Kenji did in 2016?\nThe most relevant bit of Kenji's test was how the overnight resting affected chili:\nThe only case in which there was a noticeable difference was with the chili, where the older batches were distinctly more rounded and mellow in flavor. This isn't a good thing in chili, where I expect brightness and heat to stand up to the roasted flavor of the dried chilies and the richness of the thick stew.\nWhere Kenji saw a flaw in the acidity and brightness of the chili becoming subdued overnight, I see a boon to an extremely acidic dish like adobo. \"Bright\" can easily veer into \"harsh\" territory when vinegar is used in excess, but when the adobo sauce is cooked, cooled, and reheated, its acidity becomes more rounded and mellow in a good way, allowing the other flavors in the sauce to come through despite the vinegar's heavy presence.\nServing Chicken Adobo\nServing chicken adobo with rice is a given, since you need something relatively bland to offset the braise's aggressive seasoning. But the absolute best way to serve chicken adobo is with greasy and very garlicky fried rice. The oiliness of the rice is important, since it helps to provide a little balance to each bite of chicken and sauce.\nOf course, garlic fried rice is an exceedingly simple preparation, consisting of only three ingredients—garlic, rice, and oil. There's really only one way to mess it up, and that's by burning the garlic.\nYou can certainly produce great garlic fried rice by tossing oil in a wok, adding a bunch of sliced garlic and letting it cook for a second, then adding cooked rice and tossing it all together. But if you really want to guard against turning your adobo side dish into an acrid mess, you can infuse the cooking oil with garlic first, strain out the perfectly cooked garlic shards, then fry the rice in garlic-infused oil.\nOnce the rice is completely broken up and warmed through, you can add the cooked garlic bits back to the wok, then serve the rice with a couple pieces of the chicken adobo, and plenty of sauce alongside to spoon over the top.\n")

# author_id: 1,
# kicker: "We explore Cambodian cuisine with Chinchakriya Un and her mother, via two classic dishes.",
# body: "If you don’t have Cambodian relatives or friends, it’s quite possible you’ve never had the good fortune of eating the delicious food of this coastal Southeast Asian country. In cities with small Cambodian communities, restaurants and grocery stores serving or selling Cambodian dishes and ingredients are few and far between. But if you find yourself at a Cambodian restaurant, or if you’re lucky enough to score an invite to a Cambodian friend’s home for dinner, you’ll immediately understand what sets this food apart from that of neighboring Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam.\nCambodian cuisine is more pungent and tart than that of most other Southeast Asian countries. Many dishes owe their intense flavors to prahok, a powerfully fragrant fermented fish paste made by leaving fish in the baking sun for a day, then piling it into jars or baskets with plenty of salt. Often, the fish is fermented for so long that when it's added to a dish, it dissolves on contact, its flavors melting into the mix.\nTamarind or tamarind soup powder is used to flavor a variety of dishes as well, lending a balance of sweet and mouth-puckeringly sour. Cambodian cooks also pound herbs and spices into a wide variety of pastes, known as kreung, which act as the base for countless stir-fries. These pastes often include makrut lime leaves, lemongrass, galangal, ginger, and plenty of fresh herbs, though the ratios of these ingredients vary depending on the dish they’re being incorporated into.\nTo get a better sense for what really defines Cambodian food, I spent a day cooking with my friend Chinchakriya Un. Chinchakriya, who was born in a refugee camp in Thailand and moved to the US with her family while she was still a baby, hosts pop-up lunch and dinner events in New York City. (The pop-up, Kreung, takes its name from the above-mentioned ubiquitous Cambodian flavor base.) Hosting these events is a way for Chinchakriya to preserve Cambodian culture and to create a gathering space for other Cambodians far from home.\nBefore we started cooking, Chinchakriya set up camping stoves in her sunny Brooklyn backyard, so the smell of fermented fish and the punch of chili wouldn’t soak into her walls and linger. We were lucky enough to be joined by Chinchakriya’s mother, Kim, the culinary matriarch of the family, who watched over and advised us as we prepared a small feast.\nAs I chopped galangal and Chinchakriya sat on the floor pounding spices and curry leaves in a mortar, she walked me through the dishes we were making. We started with cha kreung satch moan, a chicken stir-fry colored green by a pungent kreung of makrut lime leaf and lemongrass. Then we moved on to somlor machew srai, a fish and crab soup with crisp water spinach, made with a tart tamarind base.\nWhile we cooked, Chinchakriya laid out the most important components of Cambodian cooking. There’s the layering of varied textures—crisp jalapeños added to the chicken stir-fry right before it’s pulled from the heat, for instance—and the way in which salt and fish sauce and chicken bouillon are all added to the wok in turn, in order to provide as many different sources of salt and flavor to each dish as possible.\nThe ingredients themselves are important, too. Plenty of prahok, fresh galangal, lemongrass, ginger, spicy little peppers, tulsi—the herb, also known as holy basil, has a peppery, menthol-like bite—and fish sauce were all within arm’s reach while we cooked. The chicken bouillon added to the chicken stir-fry and the tamarind soup mix stirred into the soup in place of pounded fresh tamarind are a testament to the way many immigrants adapt when resources and time are short, and there are families to feed.\nKim cooked these same dishes with her own mother in Cambodia. She ate the fresh seafood soup with vegetables plucked from the rice paddies surrounding her home, with fish the men in her family caught. When she came to the US as a refugee, she continued to make these dishes from memory, adapting them to fit her new life and growing fresh herbs and vegetables in her garden to incorporate into each meal. On this trip to visit Chinchakriya, she brought her own fermented fish paste and makrut lime leaves grown in her South Carolina garden.\nAs we sat in Chinchakriya's backyard to eat the bright chicken stir-fry and light seafood soup, Kim and Chinchakriya debated the best way to serve the dishes—over rice, in separate bowls, or all piled together. Chinchakriya didn't learn to cook Cambodian food until she was an adult living in Brooklyn, so when Kim visits, they spend most of their time together cooking and visiting Asian grocery stores searching for ingredients. Chinchakriya absorbs all of her mother's tips and stories.\nAfter watching Chinchakriya and Kim make cha kreung satch moan in their backyard, I took to our Serious Eats test kitchen to re-create the lemongrass chicken stir-fry. The recipe attached here is only slightly adjusted from theirs; it calls for cooking the stir-fry in two batches so the chicken doesn’t steam from overcrowding, and it gives the option to swap out the sometimes-difficult-to-find holy basil for Thai basil. Fermented fish, another tough ingredient to find if you don’t have access to Asian markets, is also an optional ingredient in this recipe. Otherwise, our cha kreung satch moan stays true to the flavors and techniques of the original dish.\nFor mother and daughter alike, cooking this food is about more than just nourishment or familiarity, though both are important—they cook to preserve and celebrate their culture, and to ensure it doesn't get lost in a country where Cambodian flavors are still unknown to many.\n")

# author_id: 1,
# kicker: "The humble, much-loved potato skin reaches new heights with new techniques.",
# body: "One of the weird side effects of living most of my life in New York City is that I'm deeply out of touch with significant aspects of the American experience. I know this in my bones: When I'm abroad and people ask where I'm from, my answer, instinctively, is not that I'm an American but that I'm a New Yorker.\nOne of the ways this manifests itself is through food. When I was a teenager, I did an Outward Bound trip in the Smoky Mountains of North Carolina. It was grueling: days upon days of off-trail backpacking, shooting a bearing with a map and compass, crawling on wet and muddy bellies through thickets of rhododendron so impenetrable, we took to calling them hell. We'd often hike nearly nonstop for 18 hours or more in search of a place to make camp.\nDelirium set in during those late hours, after our flashlight batteries had died and our straining eyes saw things in the forest shadows that weren't there. Desperate talk of the foods we missed most would start around this time, too. The kids in my group all cried for Waffle House. I whined for dim sum. They had no idea what I was talking about, and I was just as perplexed by them.\nThis leads me to potato skins, a nationally adored bar snack common to suburban strip malls and TGI Fridays that, based on the handful of times I've eaten them, I've never found to be all that good. I know that smacks of the kind of elitism coastal urban dwellers like myself often get accused of, but I can just as easily argue that I have more clarity about a potato skin's shortcomings because my judgment isn't influenced by nostalgia.\nI'll be direct: Traditional potato skins are no better than I'd expect oily russet jackets to be, which isn't all that good. Load 'em up, do what you want, but the fact remains that the underlying starchy tuber just isn't at its best like that. It's not as crispy on the outside, nor moist on the inside, as I want it to be. The results are even more disappointing with home-cook-targeted versions of the recipe that opt for the easier, oven-based method.\nOf course, there are solutions—there's no reason a potato skin has to be mediocre. The first step is to treat potato skins like French fries by committing to deep-frying them. Beyond that, we need to rethink their form. I'm not against the long, canoe-like shape of a traditional potato skin, but cutting them the opposite way, into deeper cups, opens up a world of serving possibilities.\nWith a crunchy fried shell and ample cup, they take on new life. They can stand in for things like potato pancakes and blini to act as containers for sour cream or crème fraîche or a multitude of other cold fillings. Take that thought just one step further, and they can replace potato chips as scoops for dips and spreads. (See the linked recipes at the top and bottom of this article for just a few ideas.)\nThe details, of course, are what matter most. Simply dropping a hollowed-out potato into a deep fryer won't get you all the way there, since what comes out is often either leathery or (a side effect of pursuing a crispier crunch) too darkly fried. I've been working on a better method, and here's what I've found.\nMost potato skins are made from russet potatoes, the same extra-starchy kind that are most often used for French fries, mashed potatoes, and baked potatoes. Russets (also known as Idaho potatoes) are the most common type in the United States, but that doesn't mean they're automatically the best for potato skins.\nOne of the biggest problems with using russets for potato skins is their extreme starchiness. It's perfect for French fries, yielding an airy and fluffy interior inside, and it makes lovely mashed potatoes for the same reason. But when left plain, the dryness of that high-starch, low-moisture flesh makes a russet one of the least pleasant potatoes to eat. That's why baked potatoes are best when absolutely saturated with butter, sour cream, and anything else that can mitigate the russet's natural texture.\nAdd to that a russet's inherently thin, papery skin—the supposed highlight of the dish—and things get even worse.\nThe standard treatment of potato skins tries to alleviate these problems with toppings like melted cheese and bacon bits. That all helps, but I don't think it does enough to save potato skins from themselves.\nAfter rounds of side-by-side testing, I came to the conclusion that the first step to a better potato skin is to choose a different potato. Yukon Golds and other yellow varieties have more tender skins and a moist, waxy flesh that holds up on its own, even without the accoutrements. Because of that extra moisture, it can be difficult to get them crisp enough in the oven, but they can't withstand the mighty power of scalding oil.\nBy committing to deep-frying potato skins, we're free to use the right potato—a Yukon Gold—and get it as crispy as we want it.\nExploring Other Dimensions\nThis story didn't start with potato skins. It started with a dish of potato \"husks,\" served at a Brooklyn restaurant called Glasserie. A few of my colleagues had fallen in love with them and were eager for a Serious Eats version of the recipe.\nTheir excitement about these husks was due only partially to the fact that the skins had been deep-fried. That in itself was not the most innovative thing about them—deep-fried potato skins are not a new idea. What really made them special was their form: Instead of halving the potatoes lengthwise to make canoe-shaped vessels, the restaurant had cut them across their equators to form smaller, but deeper, potato cups.\nThis made them easier to pick up and eat as a finger food, and it allowed them to function as scoops, which is exactly how the restaurant intended them, selling them alongside a variety of spreads and dips. It's a clever change that pushes the potato skin into potato-chip territory, each piece just the right size for a single scoop. Try it with the more traditional potato-skin shape, and you're forced to either double-dip or finish off the remainder of your potato skin plain, which—as we all know—no one really wants.\nIf you can find smaller potatoes—say, about five or six ounces (140 to 170 grams) each—that'll give you what I think is the perfect scoop size, but larger potatoes will work, too. This is true whether you use the skins as scoops or as pre-filled potato cups. If you do pre-fill them, you may want to consider slicing off just a bit of the bottom of each cup before you fry it, to make a level base for it to stand on without tipping over.\nFrying Time\nThe main thing I wanted to figure out for my recipe was how to get a potato cup with maximum outer crispness and maximum inner moisture. I played with a variety of methods: par-baking the potatoes before frying; using Kenji's French fry method of parboiling them in salted and acidulated water before double-frying them; scooping and frying them from raw, without any par-cooking method; and both single- and double-frying the cups.\nPar-Cooking: On a Par With the From-Raw Approach?\nBefore frying the potatoes, I first had to figure out whether par-cooking them was necessary. We know from Kenji's French fry experiments that parboiling French fries is an important step. I also figured that it might be easier to scoop the flesh from a par-cooked potato than from a raw one, so I added par-baking and microwaving to my list of methods to try.\nMy gut told me that the French fry method would be the best, given that I was essentially making a French-fried potato skin, but my testing didn't entirely support that. While I preferred the potatoes that were fried twice (as French fries are), I got just as good results from par-baking the potatoes (microwaving them works, too) as I did from parboiling them. And, since sending them on a quick trip to the oven or microwave is easier than setting up a salty and vinegary pot of water, that's what I settled on.\nI was able to scoop and fry the potatoes from raw, but it was easier to scoop the ones that had grown more tender via a par-cooking step. Plus, I liked the rougher interior surface that I got from scooping out the cooked potatoes better than I liked the more perfectly flat and smooth interior I scraped away in the raw ones. Turns out, imperfection in the scooping step leads to a more interesting texture later.\nGetting the Crispiest Shell\nSo far, I'd figured out that par-baking or microwaving the potatoes was the way to go, and I liked the results of double-frying more than single-frying. But I still wasn't getting the results I was after, which were potato skins crispy enough to justify the annoyance of deep-frying (let's be honest, deep-frying sucks). I sought my solution in a slurry of potato starch, into which I dipped each potato cup before frying.\nThe cups fried to crisp and crunchy shells, but, weirdly, they resisted browning, so each potato cup ended up with a white fried exterior. They also lacked an obvious potato character—clearly because potato starch is refined beyond the point of being recognizably potato-like in flavor.\nAt this point, Vicky, who was photographing all of my testing, asked why I didn't try using the scooped-out potato flesh to make the slurry. One of the dangers of being an expert is that when someone asks you a question you don't have an answer to, you're often tempted to pretend you do. I felt the urge to make something up (\"Because you're saving that to make a side of mashed potatoes!\"*). Instead, I admitted that I had no idea.\nAs it turned out, hers was the stroke of genius. A slurry made from the potato flesh is the ideal coating for a lacy and crispy coating on each potato cup that browns up beautifully, while looking and tasting like actual potato.\n
# You can choose one of several ways to make the slurry. I found the easier way was to blend it with water, using an immersion blender, until it took on the consistency of applesauce—thick enough to lightly coat the potatoes, but not in an overly gloppy way. You could also do this in a countertop blender or food processor, or you could even mash the potatoes with a fork until you've formed a slurry (a few tiny lumps won't hurt).\nOne of the big side benefits of the slurry coating is that it crisps to a crunchy shell even faster than the plain potato does, helping to ensure that the final cup hasn't had every last ounce of inner moisture fried out of it. It truly does deliver the best of both worlds, a feat no oven-baked potato skin I've met could dream of.\nServe the fried cups on a plate or tray alongside dips like hummus, tzatziki, baba ganoush, or thick Greek yogurt or labneh. Or fill them with something tasty, like pulled pork (melting some cheese on top, too), or a big, creamy dollop of crème fraîche or sour cream, topped with a slice of smoked salmon. Or, just melt a whole lot of cheese right in the center of each cup.\nThe ideas are endless. Fry up your own and go wild.\n")

The result is this recipe, which we firmly and un-humbly believe will deliver the greatest roast potatoes you've ever tasted: incredibly crisp and crunchy on the outside, with centers that are creamy and packed with potato flavor. We dare you to make them and not love them. We double-dare you.",
ingredients: "Ingredients\nKosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon (4g) baking soda\n4 pounds (about 2kg) russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters, sixths, or eighths, depending on size (see note)\n5 tablespoons (75ml) extra-virgin olive oil, duck fat, goose fat, or beef fat\nSmall handful picked rosemary leaves, finely chopped\n3 medium cloves garlic, minced\nFreshly ground black pepper\nSmall handful fresh parsley leaves, minced\n",
directions: "Directions\n1. Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F/230°C (or 400°F/200°C if using convection). Heat 2 quarts (2L) water in a large pot over high heat until boiling. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt (about 1 ounce; 25g), baking soda, and potatoes and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about 10 minutes after returning to a boil.\n2. Meanwhile, combine olive oil, duck fat, or beef fat with rosemary, garlic, and a few grinds of black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just begins to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl. Set garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately.\n 3. When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about 30 seconds to allow excess moisture to evaporate. Transfer to bowl with infused oil, season to taste with a little more salt and pepper, and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato–like paste has built up on the potato chunks.\n4. Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. Using a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.\n5. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and minced parsley. Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.")

post9 = Post.create(id: i, title: "Get to Know Culantro, the Herb That's More Cilantro-y Than Cilantro",
author_id: 1,
kicker: "Like cilantro, but turned up to 11",
body: "Culantro is one of those herbs I'd always paused and wondered over in stores, but never taken the time to really investigate, much less buy and use. While it's widely employed in Caribbean, Latin American, and Southeast Asian cooking, it's not something I tend to find in my East Atlanta Kroger—it's more the province of a Buford Highway Farmers Market—and it's certainly not as ubiquitous here as the very similarly named, but not at all similar-looking, cilantro.\nThe plant, Eryngium foetidum, which also answers to fitweed, ngò gai, and a handful of other names (in addition to sometimes being referred to as, yes, \"cilantro\"), is native to Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean, but is grown in tropical zones worldwide. It produces long, pretty, true-green, sawtooth-edged leaves that smell very strongly of, well, cilantro. It's like a concentrated dose of cilantro aroma and flavor, intense enough to waft up from a grocery bag or smack you in the face as you move it from the refrigerator shelf to the counter. (Apparently whoever gave it its Latin name didn't care for this quality, since foetidum means \"stink\"; I can attest that if you like the smell of cilantro, you should find nothing objectionable about its cousin.)\nAs such, according to culinary experts I sought out to fill in the gaps of my ignorance, it can be used in many of the same contexts you'd find cilantro, with a couple of important distinctions. First, because culantro is more potent, you'll need to use less of it. Second, it's suitable for long-cooked dishes in which cilantro would impart bitterness or lose its more delicate flavor.\nEnrique Awe, chef at the Running W Steakhouse & Restaurant in San Ignacio, Belize, uses culantro in beef and chicken soups, rice and beans, and stewed beans. \"It offers a very nice, herby, citrusy taste,\" he says. \"Also, the flavor blends very well with coconut milk.\" He recommends tearing or cutting the leaves before adding them to stews to release better flavor.\nIllyanna Maisonet, who writes the Cocina Boricua column for the San Francisco Chronicle (making her the first Puerto Rican food columnist in the country), notes that culantro is an essential ingredient in Puerto Rican recaíto, a kind of sofrito that includes no tomato and forms the base for many Puerto Rican dishes. Whole leaves of culantro, also called recao in Puerto Rico, can be added directly to your blender for recaíto, or they can be cut into chiffonade and added to salads or used as a garnish, Maisonet says.\nAfter picking up a package of culantro at the Lake City International Farmers Market (if you haven't figured this out by now, \"farmers market\" often means something quite different in Atlanta), I experimented by making a mini batch of Kenji's basic guacamole, substituting culantro for cilantro. I started with about half of the volume of cilantro called for in the recipe, but ended up adding a little more than that after tasting for seasoning.\nSneaking a few bites of the raw herb, I found it had a slight sharpness, almost pepperiness, that cilantro doesn't. And, real talk from a far-from-pro cook: I liked that the broad, flattish, relatively sturdy leaves are easier to cut than cilantro's thin, frilly ones, and don't require stripping. (Not to mention the fact that I had to chop a smaller amount overall.)\nCulantro is still rare in the dominant supermarket chains of the continental US; your best bets for finding it are Asian and Latin American markets.\"Check that one local Asian market that is known to carry everything,\" Maisonet advises.) After purchasing, wrap the leaves loosely in a damp paper towel, place them in an unsealed plastic bag, and use within about a week.\nOne last note: Attempting to confirm or deny this is beyond the scope of this article (a.k.a. the time I have to get it in on deadline), but a few murmurs on the internet report that culantro doesn't taste soapy to some people, as cilantro does. The two plants belong to the same family, but are not related beyond that, so it seems plausible that culantro wouldn't necessarily trigger the same perception of soapiness. If you're a cilantro-hater who's tested out culantro as a substitute, do your fellow cilantro-haters a solid and let us all know if it worked out for you, or if you're back to swapping in parsley.\n")

# author_id: 1,
# kicker: "The one thing that makes all those early-morning temple visits more bearable: snacks.",
# body: "Growing up, our household of four would rise early—way too early—on the first day of Diwali, the Hindu \“festival of lights.\” It was technically a holiday, but we still had to wake up at 7 a.m. While old-timey Hindi film songs played on All India Radio’s early-morning show, and our parents, who had already been up for hours, bustled about the thoroughly cleaned house—Dad placing little earthen oil lamps along the windowsills, Mum drawing elaborate rangoli designs with fine colored sand, flowers, or colored rice near the doorway—my sister and I would blearily call dibs on who would go bathe second, so that the other could grab a few more minutes of sleep. After the bath came a visit to the neighborhood temple in our new clothes, lighting firecrackers, and walking around a city twinkling with lights—Diwali made everything look bright and shiny and filled with the promise of new beginnings.\nDiwali is celebrated differently depending on what community you are from and where in India you live, and is associated with a number of rituals and deities, but the most popular origin story is linked to the Hindu mythological epic Ramayana. In a nutshell (there are many, many subplots), a demon king named Ravana kidnaps Sita, the wife of Lord Rama, and is defeated after a long, heroic battle. When Sita and Rama, newly reunited, begin the journey back to their kingdom, the people light rows and rows of oil lamps along the way to guide them; the light symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.\nEach day of Diwali has its own theme or tradition, from the burning of an effigy symbolizing Ravana and ceremonies dedicated to Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity, to events like Bhai Dooj, which celebrates the bond between siblings, and Padwa, dedicated to married couples. Some communities carry out rituals dedicated to the goddess of wisdom, Saraswati, while others consider Diwali the start of a new year.\nThe one thing that has likely made the early-morning temple visits more bearable for generations of Diwali revelers is the prospect of finally arriving home, shrugging out of the itchy finery, and stuffing your face with heaps and heaps of Diwali-special eats, a dazzling array of sweets and snacks, ideally consumed for all meals, round the clock, for the entire duration of the festival: glass jars filled with chiroti and sev, giant aluminum tins packed with chakli, platter after platter of sweet-spicy chivda, and bottomless bowls of crunchy shankarpali. This Diwali spread is called faraal in Marathi households like ours, but several of these sweet and savory foods are also consumed in other regions of the country, under different names. Some are specific to certain places or communities; others are universally loved.\nA one-size-fits-all guide to Diwali favorites is hard to make. Debates about the best and worst snacks can get heated. Still, here is a (somewhat) humble attempt at compiling a list, definitely tainted (or elevated) by personal opinion.\nShankarpali\nShankarpali are the literal best. No, really: Sugary, deep-fried, cardamom-spiked, diamond-shaped munchies, small enough to fit half a dozen in your hand—the minimum amount you need to consume or forever be shamed before the entire pantheon of 360 million Hindu gods. The dough is made from maida, a finely milled wheat flour popular in South Asian countries, similar to cake flour.\nGrowing up, I’d watch Mum roll out the dough, then carefully slice a pattern of diamonds across it with the edge of the knife before frying them, and beg her to let me try. Plump and crunchy and a gentle golden brown, our stash of shankarpali filled up jar after jar. Now, we buy several packets of them at our favorite neighborhood store, only to inevitably make another trip a couple of days later.\nKaranji\nA karanji is a sweet fried dumpling, shaped like a half moon with crimped edges. It’s typically stuffed with desiccated coconut and dried fruit, but the filling can be made with fresh coconut, too. When filled with the latter, a karanji keeps for about a couple of days, which is usually as long as it takes for a massive stock to completely run out in the Phadke household. And, in my humble opinion, honed over three decades of karanji-eating, the fresh, or \"wet,\The thing I like best about karanjis is that their unsweetened crust keeps them from turning into absolute sugar bombs, the way several Indian sweets can be. They’re sweet, but not too sweet, and go perfectly with many rounds of chai on languid Diwali afternoons.\nThough karanji is a preparation from the state of Maharashtra, its counterparts can be found in other parts of India. Of these, the gujiya is the most famous, popular in northern India, especially around Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan. It’s stuffed with dried fruit and khoya, a delicious creation made by simmering milk in a large iron pan until the moisture evaporates and the milk solids are left behind. Khoya features in several South Asian sweets, particularly in northern India, and it is often unappetizingly translated to \“thickened solidified milk.\”\nOther iterations include the purukiya from Bihar and ghughra in Gujarat, although, as far as I can tell, they seem to be different in name only. There is also kajjikaya, made in Andhra and Kannada homes, which has a crisper, lighter crust.\nSev\nThink of sev as spicy, crunchy noodles made of besan (gram flour, or a flour made from either raw or roasted ground chickpeas), but broken up into hundreds of little pieces, measuring half an inch or smaller. Ideally, just small enough to eat by the fistful.\nThere are several kinds of sev across India, varying in thickness, from as thin as cake sprinkles to as thick as cheese straws, and in spice levels. For example, there’s Ratlami sev, which packs a slow, potent burn from black pepper, and the bright-yellow \“nylon\” sev that’s a popular garnish for chaat or the \“masala toast sandwiches\” sold on Mumbai’s streets.\nThe one I’m talking about here, though, is the orange kind, best consumed at home, because in shops you’ll find it all broken up into proper, packageable bits. If you’re making it yourself, however, or have managed to score an invite to the house of someone who is, you’ll get to eat it hot out of the pan, as a giant, crunchy tangle of deliciousness. A nest of flavor! A bouquet of toothsomeness! You get the drift.\nChivda\nChivda is similar to \“Bombay mix,\” an assortment of ingredients like fried lentils, peanuts, fried onion, sev, and curry leaves, though here I’m specifically referring to a version made with beaten rice flakes, or poha. Chivda’s role among Diwali snacks is similar to the one pasta salad plays at American barbecues: You spot it at nearly every single one you attend, but you don’t particularly care for it because, well, there’s so much better stuff around. But if it ever went away, you’d kinda miss it...right? Okay, honestly, I don’t know. I’m not American. But you see what I’m saying?\nChivda is one of those Diwali snacks that nearly always get left over. It’s delicious, don’t get me wrong—crispy and savory, made by first roasting the rice flakes lightly, and then tempering them with whole spices, green chilies, and as many curry leaves as you can possibly find. Add some whole roasted peanuts and fried crunchy bits of coconut, and the whole thing tastes spicy and sweet and salty. It’s actually the perfect accompaniment to all the sweets, except you’re too busy stuffing your face with the karanji and chakli to actually appreciate it in time.\nThere is also a version made with thin potato straws, called batata chivda. As much as I love potato, the batata chivda is, we must admit, the lesser chivda.\nChakli\nChaklis are a spiral-shaped, crunchy, savory snack made with an assortment of flours, including chickpea, split black gram, mung bean, and rice, with red chili powder, turmeric, and asafoetida mixed in for seasoning. A similar preparation from South India is named murukku, made from rice and urad dal flour. Chaklis have a pretty long shelf life, and also work well as chakna—assorted snacks eaten as an accompaniment to alcohol. Diwali is also a time for some partying, you know.\nKaju Katli\nKaju katli means a \"cashew slice\"—a dense, milky sweet made with, well, cashews, cut into diamond-shaped pieces, and topped with edible silver foil known as vark. A blend of ground cashews, milk, and sugar is stirred over the flame until the mixture acquires a dough-like consistency. After it cools, it is kneaded, rolled out, and cut into diamonds.\nLike the karanji, the kaju katli is among the less sweet desserts, which may be one of the reasons why it can be a bit...divisive. Haters call it bland chalk powder, but people of good taste know it to be peak-tier in the hierarchy of Indian desserts. Imagine hyping up the frankly overrated soggy mess of syrup that is gulab jamun—irritatingly present at absolutely every single North Indian gathering—while ignoring the understated beauty of the kaju katli. Imagine.\n")

To taste this particular chicken and rice you can get yourself to Midtown or try this home version by Kenji, a spot-on rendition of the street food classic. Marinated in oregano, lemon, and coriander, chicken thighs are browned, chopped into chunks and served over a pile turmeric-yellow rice.

# author_id: 1,
# kicker: "In romance-obsessed South Korea, singles get one day a year to wallow in shared misery--and noodles.",
# body: "On Instagram, a shirtless young man identified only as @hongseokhwa92 half-smiles coyly into the camera for a classically Korean mukbang-style selfie. The caption reads, \“Eating and lying down right away! Alone, with Gyo-Chon Honey Combo and one plate of jjajang.\”\nSwiping to his second photo, the viewer sees the loot on a table: a cardboard box of honey fried chicken and a bowl of jjajangmyeon. The tongue-in-cheek hashtags? \“#Eat. #LieDown #KyoChonHoneyCombo #jjajangmyeon #BlackDay #BlackDay #Healthstagram #ManWhoWorksOut #Selfie.\”\n@Hongseokhwa92 may be single—\"alone,\" as he puts it—but this type of photo has plenty of company on Instagram. Across romance-obsessed South Korea, the unattached are gearing up for April 14, also known as Black Day, an occasion for soaking up the sorrows of singledom with morbid, dark-hued foods—in particular, jjajangmyeon,* a beloved Chinese-immigrant dish of thick, chewy flour noodles smothered in a hearty, glutamate-rich black bean sauce, often containing pork, potato, zucchini, and onions.\nThis holiday of commiseration is set exactly two months after Valentine’s Day, when Korean women are encouraged to give the men of their choice chocolates, in the hope of receiving white chocolates or cookies in return on White Day, celebrated on March 14. (Judging by Instagram, some Koreans celebrate Black Day on March 14 instead of April 14, but this isn't the norm.) Valentine’s Day and White Day are part of a whole class of \“couples' holidays\”—one for each of eleven months of the year—to be celebrated only by the lucky pairs blessed with the benevolent smiles of satisfied parents and the jealous sighs of lonely singletons. Those who find themselves uncoupled are granted Black Day as a consolation prize, albeit a delicious one.\nEvery Korean rite has its associated foods, from the throwing of jujubes and chestnuts to symbolize future children at the post-wedding pyebaek ceremony, to peeling the tops of the favorite fruits of ancestors so that the spirits may easily eat them at jesa ancestor-worship rituals. Black Day, however, is a modern holiday that perpetuates an unusually ironic, rather than earnest, take on food’s place in Korean cultural rites and holidays.\nThe menu at restaurants celebrating Black Day varies: jjajangmyeon, of course (though it's a delivery or dine-in favorite all year long, consumption of the black bean noodles goes into overdrive on April 14), or noodles colored black with squid ink; black coffee; and black desserts, often containing chocolate. One cafe has even gone so far as to create a black muffin, and some restaurants host special events and competitions for the singles’ day.\nBut Gloria Seoyoung, the host of food tour Seoul Foodie Night Out, says she and many singles choose to camp out at friends’ apartments on the holiday, scarfing down jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk (sweet-and-sour pork). Not only can you get jjajangmyeon from Korean-Chinese restaurants, dropped off at your door via special fast-food delivery motorbikes, humiliated singletons can deposit their sauce-strewn plastic trays and dishes outside their apartments for pickup, never once having to face anyone except the delivery boy/comfort-food savior.\nOver time, the holiday has evolved, taking on a tongue-in-cheek tone that allows singles to mock the traditions of cutesy couples while simultaneously rejoicing in and deriding their own singledom. Black Day has become a pop-cultural joke of sorts, even permeating K-pop consciousness, with girl group Pascol releasing a pro-singles song and accompanying video called \“Merry Black Day\” (enjoy this translation of the lyrics, which calls Black Day \“couples' hell\”).\n\“It’s almost like a self-deprecating joke,\” says Summer Jung, a research fellow at Stanford who grew up in Seoul. \“[Singles] are commiserating but also celebrating.\”\nI’d never heard of Black Day until I lived in Seoul, where I dated a sophisticated Korean-Australian-Singaporean man who thoughtlessly crushed my heart like a wingtip extinguishing a Dunhill on the neon-lit Shinchon pavement. This playboy \“kicked me\” (a literal translation of the Korean phrase for \“dumped me\”) with this careless but pointed text message: \“It’s been nice knowing you and I’m glad we met…by the way, could you introduce me to a blonde American girl before you leave for New York?\” Trudging home from my version of psychotherapy, a solo, \"Aggretsuko\"-style karaoke in my striped track pants and pink hair extensions, I felt oddly broken by a relationship that had never even reached official status.\nAfter I mourned my situation with a native Korean friend, she demanded that I come over for some jjajangmyeon for Black Day. This unni (slang for \“older female friend\”), who was 32 to my 20, had been single for a decade, and her plan was to circumnavigate the globe solo after graduate school. Sitting in her cramped, cluttered apartment, stacked high with papers and snail creams, we ordered jjajangmyeon delivery with extra damugi, a tangy, yellow, pickled mu radish that perfectly lightened the heavy black bean sauce. Was I crying from my friend’s spicy kimchi side dish, or over my pathetic twenty-something existence?\nIn that airless apartment, in between wounded slurps of noodles, the sauce sticking to my lips, I listed my grievances about dating in Korea, from the ridiculous group dates to the exorbitantly expensive matchmakers to the nerve-wracking practice of sogaeting, where you blindly meet a friend of a friend. When my friend laughed at me after I lamented that I’d never introduce the perfect Korean boyfriend to my parents, I reproached her. This was serious business—I was getting old! I angrily stole several chopsticksful of her noodles.\nAt the end of the night, though, having consumed enough melodramatic K-drama arcs to cathartically purge my misery, I began to believe that I would someday find my happy ending (although, according to K-drama lore, this would happen only after I was bedridden with an incurable case of leukemia, which would woo my handsome lover back to me).\nBlack Day taught me that friends and food are a curative fount, and that fount flows with an endless supply of umami-explosive black bean sauce, best experienced with other singles. Like our Instagram friend @hongseokhwa92, I ate to bursting, hailed a cab, and lay down directly upon arriving home. Call it triaging Maslow’s hierarchy, but a food coma always helps a broken heart sleep a little easier.\n\“The ritual of sharing jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk helps rid me and my friends of depression,\” Gloria says. \“We eat and talk about boys over our food.\” Celebrants sometimes gather wearing all black, as if in mourning for their love lives, with the added benefit that black clothing won’t bear the scars of splashes of black bean sauce.\nSummer Jung says that even in elementary school, she and her friends would joke that if they were alone in their twenties, at least they could share jjajangmyeon with one another. She blames South Korea’s couple-centric culture, including the highlighting of Black Day on news channels, radio, and websites, for the ostracization of singles.\n\“In Korean society, if you're older than 25 and haven't dated anyone, they call you a magician, because it’s like you can perform magic because you're so rare and unique,\” Jung says. \“So I think that tells you how much pressure and social stigma there is against single people.\” That pressure tends to peak in the spring, the season of matchmaking, in anticipation of Silver Day (July 14), when couples exchange silver promise rings and potential spouses are introduced to families.\nAlex Paik, a director at a marketing and communications agency in Seoul, sees a lot of pressure in the several months of couples-oriented holidays, but also the potential for a romantic silver lining to Black Day’s miseries: \“Black Day perpetuates the atmosphere of courtship among those without a partner, thereby making it not awkward to bring up [courtship] in discussion with someone you're interested in.\”\nThough it's unclear exactly when and how South Korea's mid-month relationship-focused holidays, like Silver Day and White Day, got started, they're usually chalked up to the work of eager corporate marketers looking to profit off of youthful romantic longings. (One of the more absurd examples of this phenomenon, Pepero Day, calls for friends and lovers to exchange Pepero treats, a line of Pocky-like chocolate-dipped sticks, every November 11.) But Black Day is the dark finale, the Return of the Jedi of the trio of major love-centric holidays, in a nation where couples flaunt their unity on Instagram by donning matching coats, shirts, and even underwear.\nStill, there’s light at the end of the tunnel: June 14 is Kiss Day, when you can start the cycle again by confessing your affections for a crush, perhaps even sealing your new romance with a kiss freshened by the last of your Lotte Black gum. If not, Black Day will still be waiting for you next year, the friendship-solidifying holiday of a jjajangmyeon lover’s dreams.\n")

# post13 = Post.create(id: i, title: "Crispy Kimcheesy Rice: The One-Skillet Snack Your Late Night Needs",
# author_id: 1,
# kicker: "A new use for leftover rice.",
# body: "What happens when you have so much leftover rice that you get sick of fried rice? This dish is the answer to that question.\nMade with leftover rice and a list of ingredients that keep forever in the fridge—like gochujang, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and kimchi—combined with a couple different varieties of cheese, this dish is easy to put together, cheap to make, and, most important, very good to eat.\nThe rice on the bottom of the cast iron pan gets crispy while the interior stays soft, the layers of melted cheese are gooey and stretchy, the top layer of rice dries and takes on a delightfully chewy character, and the chopped kimchi on top provides a much-needed hit of acidity and funk. Finally, the cheeses on top take on a bit of char under the broiler, so each bite packs a range of textures and flavors, all of them salty and good.\n",
# ingredients: "Ingredients:\n1 tablespoon (15g) unsalted butter, softened\n4 cups cooked short-grain rice (see note)\n3 tablespoons (45ml) gochujang\n3 tablespoons (45ml) soy sauce\n1 tablespoon (15ml) rice vinegar\n4 thinly sliced scallions (~80g), white and green parts divided\n3 ounces (85g) grated low-moisture mozzarella cheese (see note), divided\n2 ounces (57g) grated Gruyère cheese (see note), divided\n5 ounces (141g) chopped drained kimchi (see note)\n1 ounce (28g) grated Cotija cheese (see note)\n",
# directions: "Directions:\n1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Grease a 10-inch cast iron pan with 1 tablespoon (15g) butter, making sure to fully cover both the bottom and the sides.\n2. In a medium mixing bowl, combine rice, gochujang, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sliced scallion whites. Using a flexible spatula, mix thoroughly.\n3. Scrape half of rice mixture into buttered cast iron skillet and, using the bottom of a drinking glass or measuring cup, press down firmly to create a single even layer of seasoned rice. Distribute half of the mozzarella and Gruyère over the layer of rice, then scrape the rest of the rice mixture over grated cheese. Using the bottom of a drinking glass or measuring cup, press down firmly to create an even top layer of seasoned rice. Transfer pan to oven and cook for 35 minutes.\n4. Remove pan from oven. Turn off oven and turn broiler on high. While broiler preheats, top rice with chopped kimchi. Distribute remaining Gruyère and mozzarella over kimchi and sprinkle Cotija over the other cheeses.\n5. Place pan under broiler for about 2 minutes, or until Gruyère and mozzarella melt and bubble and Cotija begins to char in spots. Remove pan from under broiler, top with sliced scallion greens, and serve immediately.\n")
