[{"id"=>1, "title"=>"Not the Best Chicken Adobo (but Still Pretty Good)", "body"=>"There are two truths about chicken adobo: Every Filipino family has its own recipe (and that recipe is definitely the best), and every chicken adobo tastes better the day after it's been cooked.\nAs a corollary to the first truth, I would add: Some non-Filipino families have their own recipes, too, although they're admittedly on much shakier ground with respect to claiming theirs as the best.\nCase in point: this recipe for chicken adobo, which is essentially the one my family has been cooking for about 35 years, ever since my parents cribbed it from my nanny, Erlinda, when we lived in the Philippines in the mid-1980s. It is, like all adobo recipes, salty and vinegary in almost equal measure, since the primary ingredients in most adobo recipes are soy sauce and vinegar. It's also incredibly easy to make, and, as such, has been in my regular weekly meal rotation for as long as I can remember.\nAdobo is uniquely Filipino, despite the fact that the word is Spanish and refers to dishes with some surface similarities in Mexico and Spain. But when used to refer to Filipino cuisine, it denotes both a cooking method—basically, a very acidic braise—and the class of dishes produced by that method.\nAs journalist and food historian Raymond Sokolov notes in his book Why We Eat What We Eat: How Columbus Changed the Way the World Eats, trying to demystify why Filipino dishes with clearly Spanish names somehow stand apart from other Spanish-inflected cuisines: \"For Filipino tamales, paella, and adobo, the cloak of names covers an indigenous reality.\" Essentially, Spanish colonizers arrived in the Philippines and described local dishes using their own language, so an acidic stewed dish came to be called \"adobo,\" despite the fact that the ingredients and the method were used long before the residents of the archipelago had ever even encountered Spanish people or culture.\nThat my American-Japanese household ate this regularly should come as no surprise to any Filipino, or, for that matter, any expatriate who's lived in the Philippines. As Amy Besa and Romy Dorotan write in Memories of Philippine Kitchens: Stories and Recipes From Far and Near, popular Filipino dishes, like adobo, lumpia (often cursorily described as Filipino spring rolls), and pancit (a noodle dish—also a cursory description that does not do it justice), represent the cuisine \"at its most accessible to the non-Filipino palate.\"\nSimilarly, Nicole Ponseca writes of adobo in I Am a Filipino: And This Is How We Cook, \"Who can resist the addictively sour, salty, garlicky classic adobo, which seemed to be the friendly bridge for many to connect with Filipinos?\" When my family moved to the Philippines in 1984, chicken adobo was an easy sell for my (white) American father, who, like all (white) American expats, preferred local dishes when they were made with chicken. For my Japanese mother, it was appealing because, well, soy sauce. Reductive-but-totally-accurate stereotypes aside, the dish was a hit, and it's been in the Spaeth household repertoire ever since.\nMy parents' recipe stayed pretty much the same over the years, and it was as simple as can be: Water, soy sauce, and vinegar were combined in a pot, along with some brown sugar, an enormous amount of garlic, whole black peppercorns, and several dried, dusty shards of bay leaf. Chicken legs, thighs, and wings were added to the pot, and the whole thing was simmered for about 45 minutes.\nAfter that, everything got refrigerated for dinner the next day, when the reheated adobo would be served with a big pile of super-garlicky and slightly oily fried rice—the greasiness of the rice tempers both the salinity and the acidity of the adobo sauce.\nSince leaving my parents' home, I've tinkered with their adobo recipe in small ways, and settled on a ratio of soy sauce to vinegar to water that my wife, my child, and I all prefer. I also ditched the brown sugar ages ago, because what I like best about adobo is its bracing, in-your-face quality, and I add more whole peppercorns, because I really enjoy chewing on them after they've been softened by the braise. Finally, I use fresh bay leaves instead of the dried stuff, and I always, always let it sit at least overnight in the fridge.\nGiven that the recipe I'll share with you has gone through decades of small changes, and has been passed down, now, through two generations (from Erlinda to my parents, and from my parents to me), I believe this recipe is, at the very least, authentic in spirit, if not authentic in fact, seeing as it's been devised by non-Filipino hands. I can say without reservation that it is a fine recipe for chicken adobo, although certainly not the best.\nTesting Browning\nThis site being what it is, I couldn't just write up the way I make chicken adobo. For one thing, I generally eyeball quantities and use my taste to guide me; for another, I make it differently almost every time, because adobo gives you options.\nSome days, I'd decide to make adobo because I was butchering a chicken for its breasts—making chicken piccata, say—and I had no plans for the legs. In that case, I'd split the legs into drums and thighs and dump them, along with the wings, in a pot with all the adobo elements, then simmer everything until the chicken was cooked. This makes a fine adobo, which I will eat happily every time, but even the most novice cook would be able to point out areas for improvement.\nOn other days, I'd take my time with the adobo, salting the chicken in advance, browning it thoroughly, and blooming the sliced garlic, whole peppercorns, and bay leaves in the rendered chicken fat. Then I'd use the braising liquid to deglaze the fond on the bottom of the pot, add back the browned chicken, and, again, simmer it until the chicken was done.\nAnd then there were days when, if the urge struck me, I'd take the chicken out of the braising liquid (doesn't matter which version, the browned or the un-browned); dry it off; and slide it under a broiler until the skin was a little charred and the meat was warmed through. I'd eat the chicken just like that, or serve it with garlic fried rice and a pool of the braising liquid as a sauce.\nI ended up testing all of these methods side by side. I made batches of chicken adobo in which the chicken pieces were never browned at any point. I made batches in which the garlic and spices were never bloomed in oil, and batches in which they were. I made batches in which the chicken was browned twice, both in the pot and under the broiler at the end. Based on all this, I can say with some confidence that chicken adobo any which way is delicious, and the method you choose has as much to do with personal preference as it does with how much time you have on your hands.\nI do want to take a moment to highlight what I think is the best part of chicken adobo, no matter how it's been cooked: the skin. Even if the chicken is un-browned when it goes in the pot, once it comes out, the skin is my favorite part. But I understand that many people in the US find the prospect of eating floppy braised chicken skin particularly unappealing.\nIf you, like me, actually like to eat chicken skin that's easier to slurp than to chew, I can wholeheartedly recommend going with the no-browning route. If you find that unappetizing, you'll have better success if you brown the chicken skin thoroughly first. Given that the vast majority of our readers will likely prefer it that way, I included a browning step in the attached recipe.\nIf you, like me, actually like to eat chicken skin that's easier to slurp than to chew, I can wholeheartedly recommend going with the no-browning route. If you find that unappetizing, you'll have better success if you brown the chicken skin thoroughly first. Given that the vast majority of our readers will likely prefer it that way, I included a browning step in the attached recipe.\nChicken wings adobo are almost an entirely different beast from the thighs and drums because of the way that the vinegary braising liquid transforms the collagen-rich cartilage and skin into a semisolid state. The wings, particularly the flats, are very fragile, and you have to be careful as you turn them while broiling, but the result is fall-apart-tender meat encased in semi-crispy, semisoft skin, punctuated by pops of extremely soft cartilage between your teeth.\nTesting Vinegars\nAs Besa and Dorotan note in Memories of Philippine Kitchens, \"Vinegar defines adobo.\" I believe my parents actually used Heinz distilled white vinegar for their adobo for many, many years, which means, I think, that their adobo was subpar by definition. Up until last year, I used distilled cane vinegar produced by the brand Datu Puti, which is owned by Philippine food company NutriAsia, but I stopped after reading news reports about the company's shoddy labor practices, which inspired a sustained strike by some of the company's workers in 2018. Since NutriAsia also owns the other major brand of distilled cane vinegar in the Philippines, Silver Swan, I decided to start using rice vinegar instead.\nIn developing this recipe, I tested it using a variety of vinegars: Heinz distilled white vinegar, Japanese rice vinegar (Mizkan), Bragg apple cider vinegar, and both Datu Puti and Silver Swan, tasting all of them side by side. Surprisingly, the only one I found a little odd was the batch made with apple cider vinegar; the rest tasted fine to me, although I preferred the Datu Puti and rice vinegar batches.\nBesa and Dorotan observe that they know of people who use balsamic vinegar in their adobo, and others who use coconut vinegar, and still others who use fruit vinegars of a wide variety. All of which is to say, most any vinegar will do, but for the purposes of our recipe I chose rice vinegar, since it is widely available and its production is associated with no (known) labor issues.\nDoes Adobo Really Get Better Overnight?\n\nThe claim that adobo gets better after resting overnight is one that seems to fly in the face of previous tests we've done on stews. But I did my best to test the claim, comparing a freshly made batch of adobo against one that had sat overnight in the refrigerator, and I can say without reservation that the batch that sat in the fridge overnight was better. How do we reconcile that with the tests Kenji did in 2016?\nThe most relevant bit of Kenji's test was how the overnight resting affected chili:\nThe only case in which there was a noticeable difference was with the chili, where the older batches were distinctly more rounded and mellow in flavor. This isn't a good thing in chili, where I expect brightness and heat to stand up to the roasted flavor of the dried chilies and the richness of the thick stew.\nWhere Kenji saw a flaw in the acidity and brightness of the chili becoming subdued overnight, I see a boon to an extremely acidic dish like adobo. \"Bright\" can easily veer into \"harsh\" territory when vinegar is used in excess, but when the adobo sauce is cooked, cooled, and reheated, its acidity becomes more rounded and mellow in a good way, allowing the other flavors in the sauce to come through despite the vinegar's heavy presence.\nServing Chicken Adobo\nServing chicken adobo with rice is a given, since you need something relatively bland to offset the braise's aggressive seasoning. But the absolute best way to serve chicken adobo is with greasy and very garlicky fried rice. The oiliness of the rice is important, since it helps to provide a little balance to each bite of chicken and sauce.\nOf course, garlic fried rice is an exceedingly simple preparation, consisting of only three ingredients—garlic, rice, and oil. There's really only one way to mess it up, and that's by burning the garlic.\nYou can certainly produce great garlic fried rice by tossing oil in a wok, adding a bunch of sliced garlic and letting it cook for a second, then adding cooked rice and tossing it all together. But if you really want to guard against turning your adobo side dish into an acrid mess, you can infuse the cooking oil with garlic first, strain out the perfectly cooked garlic shards, then fry the rice in garlic-infused oil.\nOnce the rice is completely broken up and warmed through, you can add the cooked garlic bits back to the wok, then serve the rice with a couple pieces of the chicken adobo, and plenty of sauce alongside to spoon over the top.\n", "author_id"=>1, "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:36:54 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:36:57 UTC +00:00, "kicker"=>"A savory, vinegary chicken stew from the Philippines.", "ingredients"=>nil, "directions"=>nil, "recipe_body"=>nil, "why_it_works"=>nil, "yield"=>nil, "active_time"=>nil, "total_time"=>nil, "rated"=>nil, "special_equipment"=>nil, "notes"=>nil}, {"id"=>2, "title"=>"The Best Crispy Roast Potatoes Ever Recipe", "body"=>"These roast potatoes maximize the crisp-to-creamy contrast in each chunk of potato.

Line an aluminum half-sheet pan with parchment along the bottom, and grease with pan spray or oil.\nFor the Cake: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, combine the eggs, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. Mix on medium-low speed until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is homogenous, smooth, and runny, but with fine bubbles beginning to form throughout, about 3 minutes.\nIncrease speed to medium and whip until the mixture is pale yellow, thick enough to fall from the whisk in ribbons, and filled with fine, foamy bubbles, about 5 minutes. Finally, increase speed to high, and continue whipping until the mixture is quite pale, roughly doubled in volume, and thick enough that the whisk leaves a vortex-like pattern in its wake, about 5 minutes. When allowed to run off the whisk and into the bowl, the mixture should be able to briefly mound up on itself before leveling off. Please bear in mind all times are ballpark figures only, and may vary considerably depending on the power and capacity of a given stand mixer, along with factors such as bowl-to-beater clearance (more on that here). In all cases, the visual and textural cues should be the primary guideline to determine readiness.\nOnce the foamed eggs are fluffy and thick, reduce speed to medium-high and add the vanilla and oil or melted butter all at once in a steady stream. Immediately reduce speed to medium-low, and add the sifted flour all at once. When the flour is nearly incorporated, shut off the mixer and remove the whisk attachment. Grasping the attachment by its top, give the batter a few strokes of the whisk by hand to finish incorporating the flour. Fold the batter once or twice from the bottom up with a flexible spatula, then scrape into the prepared pan and spread into an even layer with an offset spatula. Bake until puffed and lightly browned from edge to center, and firm to the touch but still puffy and soft enough to retain a shallow impression when gently poked, about 12 minutes.\nImmediately after removing the cake from the oven, cover the half-sheet pan with two large strips of foil, using a kitchen towel or oven mitt to crimp the foil around the edges of the pan. Allow the cake to cool until approximately 70°F (21°C) (if not allowed to cool sufficiently, it may cause the filling to melt; if cooled too much, it may harden in the cold and thus crack when rolled).\nLoosen the edges of the cooled cake from the pan with a butter knife, and give the cranberry jam a good stir before spreading it into an even layer over the cake. Please see the note about using other jams or jellies, as the exact amount (in terms of both weight and volume) will differ substantially depending on the consistency and moisture content. Working along the widest end, lift the edge of the cake by the parchment underneath and gently fold it inward until it turns over itself. Continue rolling, using the parchment to lift and maneuver the cake; it will naturally peel away as you go.\nAfter rolling, transfer the cake to a large platter and serve right away, or cover with plastic until needed. If you like, make a simple frosting by whipping the apple-cinnamon sugar, cream, and salt together until thick and stiff enough to spread; this can be refrigerated in an airtight container and used to cover the cake just before serving. Alternatively, the cake can be finished with a dusting of powdered sugar.

Otherwise, a traditional cake pan of those dimensions will work, with a touch more effort to unmold. Of course, cheesecake can be baked in any size or style of pan, but the volume of batter, bake temperatures, and times will require individual adjustments which have not been tested here.\nIf using a two-piece pan, wrap the bottom piece in foil before assembly, then tear away the excess so the pan sits flat. If using a traditional cake pan, line the bottom with a parchment round (explanation and tutorial here). In either case, lightly grease the pan.\nFor the Graham Cracker Crust: Add the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and salt to the pan, and stir with a fork until well combined. If needed, season to taste with additional salt. With your fingers, compress into an even layer along the bottom of the pan.\nFor the Cheesecake: Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 450°F. Combine cream cheese, goat cheese, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt, and orange flower water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Do not add the sugar at this time. Mix on low until roughly combined, then increase to medium and cream until no lumps of cheese remain, and the mixture is perfectly smooth; about 5 minutes. Halfway through, pause to scrape the bowl and beater with a flexible spatula.\nReduce speed to medium-low, add the sugar all at once, and mix only until well combined. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and place a single-mesh sieve over the bowl, then crack in the eggs, and whisk until they pass through. Discard any clots of chalazae that remain trapped in the strainer. Resume mixing on low until well combined, then scrape the bowl and beater once more.\nIn a 1-quart stainless steel pot, bring the cream to a full boil. While mixing on low, add the hot cream all at once in a steady stream, and mix a few seconds more. This warms the batter, which helps release any air pockets introduced in mixing while reducing the overall bake time. Use immediately, or refrigerate the batter in an airtight container until needed, up to one week. Bring cold batter to room temperature before baking.\nPour batter into the prepared pan and place on a baking sheet. Bounce a spoon across the surface to dislodge any air bubbles that may have slipped through. If you don't see any, no need to continue. If you do notice a few rising up, keep bouncing the spoon until they're gone. Bake until the cheesecake is puffed and dry to the touch around the edges, about 20 minutes. In most ovens, the cheesecake will also begin to brown, forming golden patches along the surface, deepening its flavor. If needed, rotate the baking sheet to ensure even browning. Alternatively, for a denser, paler cheesecake, skip to the next step and bake only at 250°F until done; this may take an hour or more.\nTurn off the oven, open the door, and let it stand ajar 10 minutes. Close the door and set the oven to 250°F. Continue baking until the outer edge of the cheesecake feels firm, though the innermost ring of cheesecake will wobble quite freely if you shake the pan, about 35 minutes. This wobbly zone should be no more than 3-inches across. The cheesecake will be done when the very center registers 145°F on a digital thermometer inserted to a depth of 2-inches. Testing with a thermometer will not cause the cheesecake to crack; cracking is the result of over-baking and nothing more.\nLet the cheesecake cool for 15 minutes, then run a thin knife or offset spatula around the sides to loosen (this helps the cake settle evenly as it cools). Continue letting it cool at room temperature for at least 1 hour (or up to 4) before covering it to refrigerate until cold to the core, at least 12 hours.\nUnmolding the Cheesecake From a Loose Bottom Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Place the pan on a large can of tomatoes or a similarly sized object; something tall enough to lift the cheesecake 4-inches from the counter, and wide enough to form a stable base. With both hands on the sides of the pan, pull downward to drop the outer ring away from the bottom. Place the cake onto a flat work surface, loosen it from the bottom of the pan with an offset spatula, and transfer to a large, flat serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days.\nUnmolding the Cheesecake From a Traditional Cake Pan: Loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the pan with a thin knife or offset spatula. Stand the cake in a few inches of scalding hot water until the pan feels warm (a roasting pan works well for this). Drape the cake in plastic wrap to protect its surface, then invert onto a large, flat plate, and lift the pan to pull it away. It should slide free without any resistance; if not, continue standing in hot water a few minutes more. After removing the pan, peel the parchment from the crust, and re-invert the cheesecake onto a serving plate. Cover with plastic and refrigerate until needed, up to 10 days.\nTo Serve: Combine the fresh fruit and warmed fruit syrup or jam in a large bowl, and gently fold with a flexible spatula until the fruit is well coated and glistening (optional).

The grains of rice can be fully ground, partially ground, or left whole, for a range of potential textures. Add-ins can be anything from chicken or beef to abalone, jujubes, nuts, pumpkin, and more. Its generally mild flavor and soft texture make it the kind of comfort food that's ideal for feeding the sick, the elderly, and babies, but it's definitely not limited to those groups—anyone can enjoy a warming bowl of juk at any time.\nThis recipe is for a classic dak (chicken) juk, and while it's a fundamentally simple preparation, there are a few key details that ensure great results. Firstly, you'll want to mince the vegetables (in this case, that's carrot, onion, and zucchini) as finely as possible—ideally to a size comparable to the grains of rice themselves, allowing a seamless textural interplay of vegetables and rice. Cut larger, and the vegetables in this particular recipe seem clunky and awkward.*\nAlso critically important is the quality of the broth you use. Yes, you can make a quick juk with store-bought stock and some bits of leftover cooked chicken, but you'll get far better flavor if you make your own. This is a dish of few ingredients, after all, so the ones you use really show through. It's not too much trouble—just simmer a whole chicken in a pot with water and aromatics—but it does take some time, since you need to make the broth first (though that time coincides with the soaking time for the rice, so you're not really speeding up the process if you skip making the broth from scratch).\nFinally, it's crucial that you sauté the rice in oil before adding the broth. This develops the rice's flavor, just as it does in an Italian risotto. Furthermore, Serious Eats recipe contributor and Korean-cooking expert Seoyoung Jung says that toasting the rice also helps ensure the grains remain whole even as they meld into the porridge, a texture that she describes as \"still alive,\" and one that's important to a well-made juk of this style.", "why_it_works"=>"Soaking the rice grains helps hydrate them, softening them more quickly in the porridge.\nA last-minute addition of finely minced raw garlic adds a subtle punch of flavor.\nA homemade broth pays dividends, guaranteeing a good base flavor to the porridge while also yielding shredded meat.\nToasting the rice in sesame oil develops its flavor.", "yield"=>"Serves 4 to 6", "active_time"=>"1 hour", "total_time"=>"2 hours", "rated"=>5, "special_equipment"=>"Dutch oven, 3-quart saucier, fine-mesh strainer", "notes"=>"The juk can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.

First is the thickness of your brisket. Pieces that are closer to about two inches thick will take longer to tenderize, requiring a slightly longer cooking time of about an hour and a half (keep the cooking time at an hour if you don't mind a little more chew). Thinner ones that are about one inch thick, as brisket is sometimes sold, only take about an hour\nAlso, pay attention to the cut of brisket you're using. Most of the time, you'll have what's called the \"flat\" or \"first cut,\" which is the leaner slab of the cut. It tends to dry out more and requires longer cooking to tenderize. The fattier \"point\" or \"second cut\" is less common, but it yields juicier, richer meat. It also tenderizes a little more quickly, thanks to all that intramuscular fat, so even a thicker slab should be very tender in just one hour.\nThe key to success in the pressure cooker is to manage your liquid level. The beef will release ample juices as it cooks, and because a pressure cooker is sealed, almost none of that liquid will evaporate away. This means you need to start with less liquid in the pot, lest you end up with beef soup, not stew.\nThe first step to reducing the liquid is to make sure you fully cook off the natural juices of the aromatic vegetables. It takes several minutes before the vegetables start to soften, and it takes several more before they reduce to a syrupy consistency. Exactly how long depends in large part on your pressure cooker: Stovetop models can do this faster than most electric ones since stovetop burners are more powerful than the heating elements in electric pressure cookers.\nAfter that, you want to introduce as little extra liquid as possible. This means using thick tomato paste instead of the juicy canned tomatoes in my traditional, oven-based recipe and fully reducing the wine, not just cooking off its alcohol. This way, when the beef goes back into the pot and adds all of its own juices to the mix, you'll end up with a dish that has a stewy consistency, not a soupy one.", "why_it_works"=>"Browning the brisket deepens its flavor.\nPressure-cooking the brisket shortens the cooking time by 2 to 3 hours.\nThinly slicing the meat and then submerging it in the braising liquid helps to reinfuse it with juices.", "yield"=>"Serves 6 to 8", "active_time"=>"45 minutes", "total_time"=>"3 hours", "rated"=>5, "special_equipment"=>"Stovetop pressure cooker or electric multi-cooker", "notes"=>"For the juiciest brisket, try to use one that still has the second cut (also called the point or the deckle) attached.

Fold back foil, increase oven temperature to 325°F, and continue roasting, basting pork with pan juices occasionally, until pork shows almost no resistance when a metal skewer or knife is inserted into it and the surface is crackly and brown, 2 to 3 hours longer. Remove pork from oven and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes.\nPour accumulated pork juices into a bowl and discard all except 1 cup.

Drizzle with fresh olive oil and top with freshly ground black pepper and grated cheese, if desired. Serve.", "recipe_body"=>"The history of ribollita is one of tradition—after making a big pot of vegetable soup, Italians would stretch any leftovers into a stew by reheating it the following day and adding beans and stale bread to the mix, thereby creating a new meal for a new day. That's why it's called ribollita, which means \"re-boiled,\" a name that describes the two-stage cooking process.\nBut while ribollita may have been born out of frugal necessity, there's no reason we need to follow that same path today. Using a pressure cooker, we can make the soup all at once in a fraction of the original's stovetop cooking time. It's such a huge time-saver, and leads to such great results, that I'm not sure I'll ever want to make ribollita without a pressure cooker again.\nA pressure cooker is the perfect tool for cooking this dish for a few reasons. First, ribollita is at its best when all the vegetables are cooked to a texture that borders on melting. And because a pressure cooker is able to cook food at a higher temperature than what's possible in a normal simmering pot, it can deliver those exceptionally tender vegetable morsels in much less time.\nAs effective as a pressure cooker is at tenderizing vegetables, it's even more so with the beans in ribollita. Dried beans, which deliver far better flavor than their canned counterparts, normally take many hours to prepare. First, there's the overnight soaking time (this can sometimes be skipped, though there's a slightly higher risk of the beans cooking more unevenly if you do), followed by a long and gentle simmer that can take well over an hour in the case of the cannellini beans here.\nWith a pressure cooker, though, you can skip the soaking step, dump the dried beans straight into the cooker, and end up with creamy, tender beans just one hour later. Because ribollita is all about making the ingredients meld together into a stew, it's totally fine if some of the beans overcook or blow out—the ribollita will be that much more delicious.\nThe two thing we keep out of the pressure cooker until later in the process are the kale, which turns to muddy mush if allowed to cook under high pressure for a full hour as well as the bread, which only needs a few minutes to absorb the broth and soften (note too that while ribollita traditionally used up stale bread remnants, you can use fresh bread instead and get equally delicious results).\nKeep in mind that while this recipe is formulated to fill a six-quart pressure cooker, you are free to make any substitutions you want, adding or replacing any vegetables or even the bean type based on your personal preferences or what ingredients you have at home. The only things you'll need to pay mind to are that you don't accidentally overfill your cooker when making substitutions and that different beans cook at different rates, so you may need to adjust your cooking time accordingly.", "why_it_works"=>"Sautéing the vegetables in oil coaxes out their flavor to make a more delicious broth.\nUsing a pressure cooker allows us to cook dried beans from start to finish in just one hour.\nContrary to popular belief, adding salt to the water when cooking beans improves their consistency.\nAdding the kale later in the cooking process ensures it retains some of its texture and doesn't turn to mush.", "yield"=>"Serves about 8", "active_time"=>"45 minutes", "total_time"=>"2 hours", "rated"=>5, "special_equipment"=>"Stovetop pressure cooker or electric multi-cooker", "notes"=>"The ribollita can be refrigerated for up to 5 days or frozen for up to 3 months.

If your broiler heats unevenly, you may need to move the sheet tray around for more even browning.

Because it's all cooked on a large half-sheet pan, it's perfect for feeding a larger group, plus the prep and cleanup are kept to a minimum.\nWhile you could use boneless, skinless chicken breasts in this recipe (we've tested it; it works), our preferred option here is chicken thighs. The dark meat is less prone to drying out with high heat, which gives you more time to properly brown the chicken under the broiler, without having to worry too much about overcooking.\nThe recipe also gives the option of using a preheated baking steel or stone to brown the chicken from the bottom at the same time (a sheet pan, even when preheated, is too thin to brown the chicken on its own, and therefore needs the help from the mass of a baking steel or stone). It's fine if you don't have one, though, you can just flip the chicken to broil the second side until browned instead. (Don't be alarmed if your sheet pan buckles when on the hot steel or stone; in our experience, a good aluminum rimmed baking sheet always returns to its normal form on its own.)\nAs with all sheet-pan recipes, it's important to know your oven well and to adjust accordingly. Some broilers are underpowered, in which case you may be better off using only a preheated baking steel or baking stone with the oven at its highest heat setting. Others may be unusually strong, in which case you may need to lower the oven rack just a bit (if you use a baking stone with an oven rack at its highest position, it's possible you won't have the clearance to insert your sheet pan below the broiler element; in that case, lower the oven rack as needed).", "why_it_works"=>"A baking steel or stone is included as an option for those who want to maximize browning.\nChicken thighs are tolerant of high heat and won't dry out during cooking the way chicken breast can.", "yield"=>"Serves 4 to 8", "active_time"=>"45 minutes", "total_time"=>"4 hours", "rated"=>5, "special_equipment"=>"Rimmed baking sheet, baking steel or stone (optional)", "notes"=>"You can wrap the tortillas tightly in aluminum foil and pop them in the oven 10 minutes before serving to heat through, while the steak and vegetables are finishing up."}, {"id"=>107, "title"=>"Fried Rice With Chinese Sausage, Cabbage, and Torch Hei Recipe", "body"=>"body", "author_id"=>4, "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:46:25 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:46:26 UTC +00:00, "kicker"=>"Make good fried rice great with a simple wok hei hack.", "ingredients"=>"2 tablespoons (30ml) chicken broth\n1 tablespoon (15ml) Shaoxing wine (see note)\n1 teaspoon (5ml) soy sauce\n1 teaspoon (5ml) toasted sesame oil\n1 teaspoon (5g) sugar\n1 large garlic clove (5g), finely grated\n1/4 teaspoon white pepper\n3 tablespoons (45ml) vegetable oil, divided\n2 cups cooked white or jasmine rice (12 ounces; 350g)\nKosher salt\n8 ounces (225g) Napa cabbage , cut into 1/2-inch pieces\n4 ounces (112g) Chinese sausage, boiled and cut into 1/4-inch pieces (see note)\n3 ounces (85g) frozen peas\n2 scallions (30g), thinly sliced", "directions"=>"For the sauce: In a small bowl, whisk chicken broth, wine, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, garlic, and white pepper together until well-combined.
