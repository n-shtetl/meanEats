When I told the customer service representative that I was sure someone had stolen my identity and was recklessly racking up charges, she let me know as gently as possible that it was, in fact, I who had spent a small fortune on espresso drinks.\nA few years ago, while still living in the Bay Area, I started to notice a new non-dairy milk popping up on felt-board café menus alongside the established members of the \"alt-milk\" community: almond, soy, and rice milk. These shops were now offering something called oat milk. At first I was skeptical of this milky but decidedly not milk substance. It's milk-ish. While I had grown accustomed to the idea of rice, almond, or even cashew and hemp milk, the idea of milking oats seemed silly—and borderline gross. I was sure the trend would remain confined to the bubble that is Berkeley’s quirky hippy food scene. But to my surprise, when I moved to New York City two years ago, oat milk was everywhere. And it quickly grew on me.\nOat milk is slightly sweet, without the almost sour taste that steamed cow’s milk sometimes takes on. It has just enough oaty flavor to be recognizable but not so much as to be off-putting or clash with coffee's natural acidity. It’s creamy, rich, and foams well for lattes and the like, which is a big part of why oat milk has taken coffee shops by storm (the other major factor was a well-devised marketing and product roll-out campaign from Swedish company Oatly, which introduced oat milk to the US market by first putting it in the hands of coffee shop baristas before making it available for purchase in grocery stores). But what, exactly, is this newly famous milk, how is it made, and—other than putting it in coffee—how can it be used?", "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:37:48 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:37:48 UTC +00:00, "post_id"=>5}, {"id"=>15, "title"=>"What Is Oat Milk?", "body"=>"Though other plant- and nut-based milks have been produced and consumed for hundreds of years, oat milk is a relatively new product. It was created in the 1990s by Rickard Öste, a Swedish scientist who was researching lactose intolerance and exploring cow’s milk substitutes. In the mid-nineties, Öste founded Oatly, which took Europe's alt-milk scene by storm before its introduction to the US market.\n“The foundational [tenet] of Oatly was the idea that... [oats have] inherent nutritional value and can be sourced abundantly,” says Mike Messersmith, Oatly’s general manager. The crops needed for oat milk production “can be grown everywhere from Sweden to Canada to Australia. And the sourcing practices and the agricultural practices associated with that do not over-tax our natural resources....We chose not to be an almond company or a soy company or a cashew company because of that criteria.” Though producing non-dairy milks results in fewer greenhouse gas emissions than raising and milking cows, these alternatives still have an impact on the environment. Oat milk production requires less land and less water than many other milk alternatives.\nIn Oatly factories, oats go through a process that uses enzymes to break down the oat starches and retains the oat fiber in the final product. Some oat milks start with an oat powder that is rehydrated, while others are fortified with an oat syrup.\nTo make the creamy, rich liquid coffee-drinkers have gone wild for, Oatly and many other oat milk companies combine their oat juice with vegetable oil, which helps emulsify the mixture and gives it body and thickness akin to whole milk. Home cooks who want to make their own oat milk can ditch the emulsifiers and follow the method used for popular nut milks: Rolled oats can be soaked in water, blended, and then strained through fine mesh or cheesecloth. The pulp is discarded, and the resulting liquid \"milk\" is saved.\nWithout the added oil, DIY oat milk won’t necessarily take as well to frothing for espresso drinks or subbing into recipes as the store-bought versions. That added fat is part of what makes oat milk such a successful substitute for cow’s milk in the fancy coffee drinks that drain my wallet.", "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:37:48 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:37:50 UTC +00:00, "post_id"=>5}, {"id"=>16, "title"=>"How to Use Oat Milk", "body"=>"Most of us became familiar with oat milk because of its meteoric rise in popularity at coffee shops, which was not a fluke. “The structure of plant-based milk is definitely different than cow’s milk,” says a New York–based barista who goes by DQ Flook, acts as a latte art instructor, and competes in latte art competitions. “Working with oat milk is amazing. I’m really happy I can make a good latte for my customers. I personally like oat milk, like other customers, in terms of creaminess and taste—especially when it mixes with coffee.”\nThough we have yet to test oat milk as a cow’s milk substitute in our recipes, we have a longstanding relationship with oats. They appear in our olive oil chocolate chip cookies, where an oat slurry stands in for eggs and provides the vegan cookies with the necessary water, protein, and emulsifying properties. Replacing cow’s milk with oat milk in oatmeal is as simple as deciding you’d like to double up on oat flavor. You could opt to mix a splash of (unflavored!) oat milk into any number of soups that call for cream, too.

This risk can be minimized by starting both of them with a little water in the pan as a safety blanket. In the case of duck skin, the water heats up and gets a jump-start on the fat-rendering process; by the time the water has evaporated, you'll have enough liquid fat built up in the pan to prevent the solid pieces of skin from burning.\nYou can render fat and make caramel without adding any water, but you have a smaller margin of error, and you have to pay closer attention to what's happening in your saucepan. The whole point of starting with the fat-rendering project is to get a hands-off task working, so don't be a hero.\nA quarter-cup of water per pound of duck fat is all you need to ensure that the pieces of skin won't stick and scorch to the bottom of the saucepan as they cook (so if you broke down two ducks, you will probably need 1/2 cup of water). There's nothing wrong with adding more water than that, except you'll have to wait even longer for it to fully cook off.\nUse a heavy-bottomed stainless steel saucepan if you've got one, as it will provide nice even heat distribution and its shiny reflective surface will allow you to clearly monitor the progress of the rendering.

Each member of the mochi family is rich with symbolism. Sakura (\"cherry blossom\") mochi—stuffed with red bean paste and wrapped in a salted Japanese cherry leaf—has become a symbol of spring, while hishi mochi—a three-layered diamond in pink, white, and green—celebrates Japan’s “Girls' Day” by representing fertility (the diamond shape) and health (the three colors are each made from a healthy ingredient).\nOne of the most significant vehicles for mochi, though, is on New Year’s Day, in a soup called ozoni, which translates roughly to “miscellaneous simmered.” As the name implies, there's flexibility in how one prepares it. Each region and family has its own style of ozoni, with differing ingredients and flavor profiles—but the one thing they all have in common are those little puffy rice pillows bobbing in the broth.\nAccording to Marc Matsumoto of the cooking website No Recipes, ozoni was originally served at the start of ritualized meals called honzen-ryōri, which were popular among the samurai. Because ozoni was the first course, it’s thought to have transitioned to the first meal served in the new year after it became more widely eaten in Japan roughly 500 years ago.\nToday, the primary components of ozoni can be split into four distinct groups: the dashi base, the broth's seasoning, the mochi, and then any additional ingredients.\nWhile there are many possible seasonings for ozoni, the biggest divide is between Kyoto's Kansai-style, known for its creamy white broth flavored with its famous saikyo miso, and Tokyo's Kanto-style, which pulls in salty umami from soy sauce, resulting in a beautiful, amber-toned soup.\nOzoni is a dish firmly rooted in the Japanese psyche, so it’s no surprise the topic can evoke a visceral reaction. When I ask Maiko Kyogoku, owner of Bessou, a Japanese homestyle restaurant in New York, about the mochi component, she lit up, describing her love for how it was toasted and crunchy in the version she grew up eating. “It was always the most exciting part!” she tells me. “You toast the mochi until it bubbles up, so it’s crunchy outside, but inside it's still gooey rice cake.”\n", "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:39:07 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:39:07 UTC +00:00, "post_id"=>12}, {"id"=>43, "title"=>nil, "body"=>"The mochi Kyogoku is referring to are kiri mochi: rectangular in shape, their surface often scored so each piece can be broken into four smaller blocks; they've become especially popular in metropolitan areas like Tokyo as they are faster and easier to produce via a sheeting process, as opposed to traditional hand-shaping.\nHistorically, however, all mochi was round—contemporary Kansai-style mochi still are. (Round, disc-like mochi shaped by hand evoke the Japanese phrase en man 円満, which translates roughly as “living in harmony and peace.” Because the character for \"en\" was also the traditional character for the word \"circle,\" round mochi came to symbolize those virtues.) “You need to eat it quickly,” Kyoguku tells me, “or else the mochi binds to each other. My sibling and I would fight over it since there’s only one to three per big bowl!”\nBeyond the broth and mochi, the uniqueness of each bowl of ozoni lies in its additional ingredients. Common ones include carrots, daikon, and kamaboko (pink fish cake), which add the lucky New Year’s colors of white (for purity) and red (pink is considered a shade of red, and red is thought to ward off evil). Leafy greens like watercress or spinach, combined with chicken, meanwhile, are meant to represent advancement in life (the traditional term for “chicken and greens” sounds similar to one that means \"honor and recognition\").\nBeyond these mainstays, ozoni often features regional specialties, like niboshi or dried anchovies in Shikoku island, or oysters in Hiroshima, nori in Chiba, or salmon and ikura (salmon roe) in Niigata. Each gives the soup a sense of terroir.\nFor Kyogoku, the process of preparing ozoni carries a gravity beyond the celebratory nature of the dish. “New Year’s was when my mom and dad could take time away from [their] restaurant…and be collaborative in our home kitchen,” she says. “The week before [January 1] they were always together. Our family’s ozoni was Mom’s, but my Dad has been making it [in her style] ever since she passed.”\n", "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:39:07 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:39:09 UTC +00:00, "post_id"=>12}, {"id"=>44, "title"=>nil, "body"=>"Kyogoku shared her family recipe with me, which I used as a foundation for the one published here; written by her father, it felt like a gift to usher in the new year.

While putting together the final recipe, I also pulled in some elements (and measurements) of Matsumoto’s personal recipe, which, as he describes, lands “somewhere between my father’s Kanto-style ozoni and my mother’s Miyazaki-style one.”\nThe result is a liquid representation of umami’s many faces: shiitake, chicken, bonito flake, kombu, and sake (which contains far more of the amino acids that we taste as umami than most other types of alcohol), coupled with textures from crunchy to sticky and almost everything in-between. It’s restrained and delicate, balanced in a way that remains attentive to each of its components.

That's because chocolate and vanilla are fundamentally different ingredients, necessitating fundamentally different approaches.\nYou can take any basic cake recipe and make it vanilla by adding a relatively small quantity of vanilla extract (a mere spoonful) or the scrapings of a vanilla pod (a few grams at best) to layer in flavor and aroma.

That means a layer cake can accommodate a pretty ridiculous amount of chocolate (my devil's food uses more than half a pound).\nBut a roulade needs enough structure and pliability to hold itself together as it is rolled or else it will crumble, crack, and fall to pieces. Search Google images for \"chocolate roulade\" to put the realities of this risk on full display. On the flip side, backing down on the chocolate will result in diminishing flavor returns; the cake will be \"chocolate\" in name only.\nFor these reasons, making a flavorful chocolate roulade that won't crack is something of a balancing act, but ultimately the solution is simple: Amp up the gluten. The first line of defense in my chocolate roulade is bread flour to increase the gluten-forming proteins in the batter from the start. To further facilitate gluten development, I increase the liquid content of the recipe via added water and an extra egg.\nIn a vanilla batter, those shifts would make the cake rubbery and tough, but that's not a risk here.

That meat should be visibly marbled with fat; there can be a thin cap of fat on top of that, but it shouldn't be excessive. If you get short ribs that have striations of muscle that look extremely lean and then a thick fat cap on top, you're going to end up with meat that's tough and dry, not tender and melting.\nShort ribs can be cut two different ways: flanken- and English-style.

Assuming you get sufficiently thick pieces of either kind, there's no other significant difference; as you can see from the photos, the ones I used were flanken-cut, and it all turned out just fine.\n", "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:39:52 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:39:53 UTC +00:00, "post_id"=>14}, {"id"=>53, "title"=>"Red Wine–Braised Short Ribs: The Secret in the Sauce", "body"=>"Most of this recipe follows the same basic template for beef stews and braises: brown the meat and aromatic vegetables, add the braising liquid, cook gently until the meat is tender. What I had to figure out for this recipe were the essential details: how much wine and how much stock to use in my braising liquid and then how to handle those liquids after the braising step, so that I ended up with the sauce I wanted, one that's thick and rich and intensely wine-y but without tasting harsh.\nFor liquid ratios, I started from a very practical place: I was going to use a single 750ml bottle of dry red wine for the braise itself. It's a sufficiently large quantity to give the sauce a predominantly red wine character, while still leaving room for just a little more liquid in the form of stock to bump up the savory base of the braise (exactly how much stock depends on whether you're cooking it in a Dutch oven or a pressure cooker; a pressure cooker's max-fill line means there's less space for stock than a Dutch oven).\nThere are all sorts of ways to thicken a sauce. You can use starches like flour or cornstarch, rely on the gelatin from a good stock, use vegetable or fruit purées, gently cooked eggs (think custards and Greek avgolemono), or rely on emulsified fats, such as in a vinaigrette. Each comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and some methods are more appropriate than others depending on the situation.\nMy goal here was to braise the short ribs and then serve them with a sauce made from their braising liquid that had a very clear, very clean red wine character. I wanted it to glaze the meat too, with a richness that thinner, lighter broths can't deliver.\nUsing a starch-like flour or cornstarch was definitely on the table—I'm not opposed to them the way some people are, as I don't always mind the subtle starchy quality they add to a sauce. They can dull flavors, which isn't great, though I think this phenomenon is sometimes over-exaggerated by critics.\nOf those two common household starches, flour is the guiltier party in terms of adding a distinct starchy taste. Cornstarch is cleaner, but when leaned on too heavily, it can lead to sauces that have a viscosity that's slightly slimy or even jelly-like, not thick in that lip-sticking kind of way. I knew I might use one of these thickeners in my sauce, but I also knew that if I relied on them alone, they wouldn't deliver the results I wanted.\nI've turned to puréed vegetables before in a braised beef shank recipe, and it's delicious, but the sauce has a consistency that makes it pretty obvious there's some kind of purée doing the thickening. All that puréeing can also incorporate air into the sauce, lightening its color. Once again, that wasn't the rich, clear effect I wanted here.\nWhat I really wanted was the thickening power of gelatin, which gives exactly the kind of viscosity I was after without adding any unwelcome flavors. In the world of sauces that means using a really good homemade stock, the kind that sets like a jelly in the fridge. You can also use store-bought stock, which is completely devoid of gelatin, and then add a packet of unflavored gelatin to it to compensate.\nMy challenge here was that the only way a good stock could sufficiently thicken the sauce was if I used a lot of it, reducing it down until the gelatin was very concentrated. Not only is that not practical at home, but it works against another of my goals: a sauce with a very clear red wine flavor, since more stock in the pot means less room for red wine. I wanted plenty of red wine.\n", "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:39:54 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:39:56 UTC +00:00, "post_id"=>14}, {"id"=>54, "title"=>nil, "body"=>"As a baker who's staked her reputation on making everything from scratch, whether ice cream cones and Klondike Bars or the rainbow sprinkles from my book, it surprises folks when I say that vanilla extract is something I'd never, ever make from scratch.\nThat's because shoving a few vanilla beans in a bottle of vodka is a simple infusion at best, not a genuine extract, and pretending otherwise is to completely misunderstand the complexity involved in manufacturing a high-quality vanilla extract (and to ignore the limitations of working on such a product at home).", "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:39:58 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:39:58 UTC +00:00, "post_id"=>15}, {"id"=>55, "title"=>"How Is Vanilla Extract Made?", "body"=>"Explaining exactly how vanilla extract is made will vary from brand to brand, and whether a producer favors a hot or cold extraction (more on that in a bit), but the best will always start with a blend of vanillas.

They work directly with the farmers on the ground (in some cases, as with Nielsen-Massey and Rodelle, that relationship may extend back through several generations).\nWorking closely with farmers allows vanilla producers to secure vanilla beans that meet their exact specifications, from length and weight to curing style and age; it also ensures the farmers get the best price for their product, as there's no middle man to contend with (some producers, like Heilala, have centered their mission statement around this relationship).", "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:39:58 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:39:58 UTC +00:00, "post_id"=>15}, {"id"=>56, "title"=>nil, "body"=>"This kind of diversity ensures a robust vanilla extract that has tremendous complexity from the start, even before producers continue to foster that complexity with all the other variables of production—such as particle size for the chopped beans, holding temperature, pressure, the number and strength of each ethanol wash, among other factors (such as bottle aging, where new flavors and a smoother profile emerge through esterification).\n", "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:39:58 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:39:59 UTC +00:00, "post_id"=>15}, {"id"=>57, "title"=>"How Extraction Works", "body"=>"Cold extractions generally involve processing the vanilla through various quantities and percentages of ethanol under constant circulation, for weeks or months, with each round aimed at pulling out a different range of vanilla's 400+ compounds. By changing the ethanol percentage with each wash, a new range of flavor can be extracted. In the end, these individual washes are blended together to create the finished vanilla. Broadly speaking, cold extractions tends to have a character that's more fruity and floral, sometimes with rum-like qualities.\nHot or pressurized extractions may involve all of that and more, as the vanilla beans and ethanol may be held at various temperatures and pressures, each likewise suited to extract a different range of flavor compounds that will later be blended into a single product. Some producers may use percolation to extract yet another range of vanilla compounds. This type of vanilla tends toward a darker character, with notes of caramel, dried fruit, or even oak.\nWhether the production is hot or cold, putting blended vanilla beans through multiple rounds of extraction pulls out the most dynamic range of flavor compounds (some water-soluble, some alcohol-soluble, some available at only this temperature or that pressure). The result is a concentrated extract that's robust enough to shine through in our favorite recipes, whether the vanilla is meant to provide an aromatic lift or stand on its own.\nAll this to say, a few vanilla beans poked into a bottle of bourbon may have a nice flavor and aroma, but it's not concentrated or layered in any way. If I had vanilla beans on hand, I'd sooner flavor a dessert by incorporating seeds from the pod or splitting the bean to infuse directly in the recipe's liquid (at least then I can use heat to my advantage).\nBut when I'm looking to add a concentrated dose of flavor and/or aroma to my desserts, whether cookie dough or cake batter, a spoonful of top-notch vanilla extract is the fastest, easiest, and most cost-effective option—particularly when buying vanilla extract in bulk compared to those tiny, one-ounce bottles at the store.", "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:40:00 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:40:00 UTC +00:00, "post_id"=>15}, {"id"=>58, "title"=>nil, "body"=>"I've mentioned in the past that I don't have a single favorite brand of vanilla.

Dry-brining produces well-seasoned meat that browns beautifully while holding onto its juices.\nFor this recipe, I took the same principles of dry-brining and replaced the salt with shio koji. Shio koji is plenty salty (\"shio\" is Japanese for \"salt\" after all), but as with other koji-derived ingredients like soy sauce and miso, it doesn't just provide salinity; it lends savory depth to foods that it comes into contact with, thanks to protease enzymes that break down proteins into amino acids, which we perceive as umami.

Even down in beef-centric Texas, pork ribs are in high demand, constituting one-third of the state’s \"holy trinity,\" along with brisket and sausage.\nBut that hasn’t always been the case. Historically speaking, ribs are relative newcomers to the pits. Nonetheless, many writers have erroneously assumed that the antebellum South was their likely place of origin. This explanation by Meathead Goldwyn of AmazingRibs.com strikes the standard chords that have led some people to assume barbecued ribs were a product of that time: \"In the pre-Civil War South, Masters got to eat the best cuts of meat. They ate the tenderloin from along the pig's back, ‘high on the hog’ (yes, that's where the expression came from), while the slaves got the tougher, more gristle-riddled cuts.\"\nBut no one was putting slabs of ribs on barbecue pits back in the 19th century. Instead, barbecued ribs are an early 20th century innovation, one driven not by the distribution of pig pars on a plantation but by the rise of industrial meatpacking, mechanical refrigeration, and commercial barbecue stands.

Fresh meat from larger livestock like pigs and cows wasn’t available year-round before the Civil War, because there was no way to keep it from spoiling. Farmers had to wait until the first cold winter weeks to slaughter their pigs; it needed to be cold enough—below 40°F—for the carcass to cool quickly and not spoil, but also not so cold that the meat would freeze.\nA hog killing on a 19th-century farm was a laborious but celebratory event, with the whole family and plenty of neighbors and friends pitching in. Almost every part of the pig was put to good use. The blood was reserved for puddings and the fat rendered into lard in giant kettles. Smaller scraps of meat and fat were ground into sausages, and the heads and feet were boiled to make \"souse meat\" or rendered into a thick, savory stew—hash and rice, South Carolina’s traditional barbecue side dish, evolved from these hog-killing stews.\nThe carcasses were then allowed to chill overnight and the next morning were cut into hams, shoulders, and \"middlings\" (side meat or bacon), which were taken to the smokehouse and preserved by curing and smoking. The parts left behind—the chine (backbone), the tenderloins, the chitterlings (intestines), and the ribs—were eaten over the next few days.\nThose traditional hog-killing dinners featured fresh roasted spare ribs and chine served with bread, potatoes, apples sauce, and cabbage or greens. And they might well be the only fresh pork a farm family enjoyed all year. They couldn’t have a hog killing during the summer—especially not in the South—for the meat would spoil in the sweltering heat long before they finished all the butchering, lard rendering, and sausage-making.\nThere was one exception to this, though. At big events, where the entire community gathered, farmers could take a few pigs to a shady grove where a barbecue pit awaited, slaughter them and remove the entrails right on the spot, and put the whole animals on the pit to cook. And that’s exactly what a 19th-century barbecue entailed.\nBarbecue originated not as a way of \"making do\" with lesser cuts, but rather as a method of whole-animal cookery—one usually staged for a large crowd. I’ve been unable to find any accounts that describe enslaved people (or anyone else, for that matter) cooking ribs or other individual cuts on a barbecue pit. Plenty of primary sources, however, describe or illustrate whole carcasses of pigs, goats, lambs, and even cows being cooked over a bed of coals in pits dug in the ground. When people in the 19th century ate barbecued ribs, they pulled the meat from a whole pig that was already cooked.", "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:41:29 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:41:32 UTC +00:00, "post_id"=>23}, {"id"=>104, "title"=>nil, "body"=>"With all this gas fleeing the beans, there's a potential problem—in order for the water to properly extract the coffee's flavorful contents, it first has to get into the beans, which it can't easily do when CO2 is rapidly bubbling out. As Nick Cho wrote in his article on making pourover coffee: \"I like to picture shoppers on Black Friday. If you opened the store for business at the same moment there was a panicky fire drill, you could have a mess on your hands. That is, unless everyone wanting in waited until everyone wanting out got out.\"\nWaiting for everyone in Nick's analogy to get out is what the blooming step during brewing is all about. It's really applicable only in a pourover setup, where the water travels continuously through the ground beans, giving them a limited shot at extracting flavor. (Beans degas when they're steeped as well, such as in a French press, but since they continue to linger in the water for the duration of the brewing phase, there's still plenty of time to get more flavor out.) Here's how it works: Add just enough hot water to wet the grounds, and wait until the foaming and puffing subsides before commencing with more water. That way, when the bulk of the water finally makes contact with the grounds, it isn't fighting against the escaping gas.\nThat's the theory. The real question, though, is just how important this step is in reality. Sure, we may know that CO2 escapes coffee beans rapidly when they're soaked in hot water, but does waiting for it to finish before adding more water really affect the flavor in our cup?

Often I sat at my grandmother's feet while she washed pots and pans or warmed up the after-lunch course. The Sunday meal is an all-day affair for Armenians.\nNo one was paying much attention to me, but there was no place where I felt more loved or safe. My parents' affections were inconsistent, their moods unpredictable, and, in those years, money was scarce. But at Grandma's, there were always hugs and kisses, copious amounts of food, and as much Coke as I wanted.\nThey're a little fuzzy on the details, but my parents agree on the first time I drank Coke. My grandmother gave it to me in a baby bottle to soothe my stomach when I had motion sickness during a short airplane trip, or maybe a car ride. I was about two years old. Through today's eyes, of course, using soda (we called it \"tonic\") as toddler medicine seems stupid and reckless, like letting an infant ride in a minivan without a car seat. But to my grandmother, who drank a lot of it herself, Coke was an all-purpose palliative for headache, indigestion, and other minor complaints.\nPlus, it tasted great. What other beverage offers its combination of spicy-tangy sweetness, extreme acidity, and brisk carbonation? There was no talk of umami or bold flavor profiles back then, but Coke was like a sledgehammer to my young palate, and, since it was offered alongside my grandmother's uncomplicated and doting affection, drinking it formed the most potent sense memory of my childhood.

In cook’s terms, controlled flare ups could generate some of the smoky, singed flavor we’re after.\nThat means we want to engineer the right conditions for flare-ups, and that means starting with moisture.

Cincinnati, blessed with a prime position on the Ohio River and close to burgeoning cornfields and hog farms, emerged as \"Porkopolis,\" the largest pork-producing city in the world at the time.\nBy 1836, Cincinnati’s four largest slaughterhouses were collectively killing and butchering some 2,600 hogs in a single day, producing between 200 and 500 barrels of pork along with 200 kegs of lard. In these early days, the tools and procedures used to slaughter a hog in a commercial setting were not so different from those of a rural hog killing; it was just conducted on a much larger scale, with each step—dispatching the pig with a blow from a hammer, scalding the carcass in boiling water, scraping the hair away—performed by a different worker, on an assembly line of sorts.\nBarrels were essential to the pork trade. With no means of refrigerated transport, packers had to preserve the meat before shipping, but they didn’t want to waste weeks slow-smoking it like farm families did. Instead, they packed the hams and shoulders in barrels, filled in the gaps with chines, hocks, and jowls, then poured in a sweet and salty \"pickle\" made from rock salt and brown sugar boiled in water.\nThe spareribs didn’t fit in the barrels, and packers found themselves with literal tons of unwanted racks on their hands. \"It is said that during the hog-killing season in Cincinnati,\" the New Orleans Times-Picayune reported in 1844, \"any keeper of a boarding-house, by sending a basket to the butcher’s, can have it filled with the finest and most delicious spare ribs, and ‘free gratis for nothing’ at that.\"\n", "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:41:35 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:41:38 UTC +00:00, "post_id"=>23}, {"id"=>88, "title"=>nil, "body"=>"But even the city’s boarding houses couldn’t eat up the supply.

Now packers could hang onto spareribs and sell them to retailers as a low-cost cut.\nRecipes for spare ribs appear in cookbooks and newspapers with greater frequency in the closing decades of the 19th century.

Behind him, employees ladle out various flavors of the traditional drink into oversized Styrofoam and plastic cups, handing them over to waiting patrons. At the front of the mural-covered room, a swamp cooler emits its sustained drone, indiscernible beneath the music pounding from the speakers. Here, in the center of Mexico's capital, Garrido tells me pulque \"is the heart of Mexico.\"\nPulque is a pre-Hispanic beverage with a consistency reminiscent of kombucha, if kombucha were made from okra. It’s about as alcoholic as beer, but it’s made from the lightly fermented sap of the agave—the same plant that’s used to make tequila and mezcal. The flavor, once you acquire a taste for it, is addictively zingy. Natural, or plain, pulque is an opaque milky color but fizzy and bright on the tongue. Sweet, but not cloying, lightly viscous but (assuming it’s fresh) not slimy, and just ever-so-subtly yeasty, like the whiff of freshly risen bread dough hitting the oven. Most places offer both plain or natural pulque and curado, or flavored, versions, which temper the drink’s tang but not its texture. And for those who enjoy it, pulque lives up to its reputation as the drink of the Gods: refreshing and eye-opening, satisfying and comforting. Even to those who find the flavor or texture gross, it offers a comforting fullness (or, perhaps, that's the light buzz talking?).\nTo produce pulque, the heart of a mature agave (maguey) plant is cut out, creating a cavity. The cavity is scraped, which induces the flow of sap, called aguamiel, into the cavity, where it gets collected. While the process for making mezcal and tequila requires that aguamiel be cooked, pulque is made by naturally fermenting the raw product in a cask. The fermentation happens quickly, so quickly that the fermented liquid reaches its fizzy, low-alcohol final form in a matter of hours.\nThe rapid fermentation is responsible for two indelible characteristics of pulque: the best pulque is freshly made, and the drink doesn’t travel well, both of which make it endemic to central Mexico. As a result, its history is closely intertwined with the history of the country, from its pre-Hispanic origins to its current revival, and the various roles it has occupied are a reflection of that, too: It was believed to be the nectar of the gods; it became the preferred drink of emperors; more recently, it was considered the scourge of the unwashed masses, which led to its colonial-era ban; and now, finally, it has become a beverage enjoyed by old-timers and young hipsters alike. The story of pulque is rich, deep, and best taken in with a long, slow pulls from a cacariza, the pockmarked glass container that is as iconic in a pulqueria as a stein in a beer hall.\nBefore the process of distillation arrived in North America, pulque ruled the region of central Mexico. A mural in Cholula called “Los Bebedores,” or “The Drinkers,” from 1000 CE offers the first confirmed evidence of pulque, but scientific research places its origin as far back as 200 CE. Pulque was thought to be a gift from the gods: Mayahuel, goddess of maguey, gave pulque to the Aztecs, and it was a sip of pulque given to Quetzalcoatl by his brother, the god Tezcatlipoca, that intoxicated him and led him to abandon his celibacy, which in turn made him decide to flee. (His return, according to the legend, was to happen in a year that coincided with the eventual arrival of Spanish colonizers.)\n", "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:41:47 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:41:47 UTC +00:00, "post_id"=>24}, {"id"=>90, "title"=>nil, "body"=>"During the Aztec era, pulque was a sacred drink, a beverage reserved for the gods and their priests.

During the colonial era, the Spanish Crown tried to outlaw pulque production, citing ties to non-Christian religions and claims that it caused major health and social issues among indigenous people. (Ironic, given that many indigenous peoples considered it curative.) But the economic power of maguey put an end to the prohibition in 1786: even during the ban, the Crown was collecting millions of pesos in taxes on pulque.\nThrough the Mexican War of Independence and the Mexican Revolution, pulque remained an important and valued beverage. But it was more than just a drink: it was medicine, culture, and a significant moneymaker. The introduction of railways sped the perishable drink from the producing haciendas in the hills into the valley of Mexico City and other cities, where there was growing demand. Toward the end of the 19th century, pulque was the main alcoholic drink and maguey production occupied an outsize role in Mexican agriculture.

Because of the limited transportation and the limited area where the agave grows, the drink stays pretty local to Mexico City and surrounding Mexico State, and the nearby states of Tlaxcala, Puebla, and Hidalgo. The fresher the pulque, the better, cleaner, and more refreshing the flavor; the drink's texture is also smoother when fresh, as it tends to grow more viscous over time and can take on an off-putting stringiness.

To pickle something is to submerge it in an acidic solution or a solution that will become acidic. We (meaning every single English speaker on Earth) also use 'pickle' as a noun to refer to things that have been in that acidic solution.

But not all acids are created equal—a wide range of acidity levels are possible, from very weakly acidic milk all the way to incredibly potent hydrochloric acid. For an acid to be useful to us, we need to identify the ones that are both palatable as food yet strong enough to kill microbes.\nWe use the pH scale to measure how acidic or basic a solution is, and that scale ranges from zero to 14, with seven being neutral (neither acidic nor basic). Confusingly, the lower the pH number, the more acidic it is, so a high-acid food will actually have a low pH. Most of the foods we eat fall within the pH 2 to pH 7 range. The good news is that microbes are more sensitive to acid than humans are; their preferred range is a pH of 4.5 to 10.* This is good news because it leaves us with the range of pH 2.1 to 4.5 in which our foods will be safe from microbial infestation yet still tasty to eat.\nWe've just identified a giant hammer in our food preservation toolbox: Changing the acidity of a food to within a range that is hostile to microbes yet palatable to humans extends the useful lifespan of that food.\n", "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:41:54 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:41:59 UTC +00:00, "post_id"=>25}, {"id"=>94, "title"=>"Let's Get pHysical", "body"=>"Back to our pH measurements.

(The same is true of highly alkaline substances; lye burns, for instance, are nasty, nasty injuries.) How can you determine the pH of your food? Measuring pH can be done by the home cook with one simple tool. No, not those little strips of litmus paper—their color changes can be difficult to read correctly. A simple digital pH meter does the job nicely. They can be found at home brew stores or online. I like and recommend the Hanna Checker Plus; it's relatively inexpensive and reads to the hundredth decimal point. Let's be clear: You don't need a pH meter to make pickles, but having one is extremely helpful for adventurous and experimental pickle makers, as it gives you the information you need to make sure your pickles are in the safe zone. The rest of us can rely on trusted recipes and a few key principles and ingredients to make pickles safely at home.\nEither way, we should all get to know our culinary acids. Acetic (or ethanoic) acid is the key component of vinegar; its pH measurement is approximately 2.4 at the 5% concentration found in most vinegars. Citric acid is found in all citrus fruits, but the ones used most often for preservation—lemon and lime juice—have a pH measurement of about 2. Tartaric, malic, and oxalic acids are found in tea, apples, stone fruits, and grapes. Those foods have an approximate pH range of 3 to 5. Out of all of these, acetic acid is the most useful to us when acidifying foods.\nWait! I know what you're going to say next: What about lactic acid? Lactic acid is created by the lactobacillus bacteria during the fermentation process that's essential to making yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and more. Lactobacillus is an 'acidophile,' which means it prefers to live in a slightly acidic environment. That's great for humans because lactobacillus not only doesn't cause us harm, but can also be beneficial to our digestive system. So yes, lactic acid creates an acidic environment that extends the life of a food, and we'll talk about lacto-fermentation a bit further along. Promise. But for now, acetic acid.\n", "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:42:00 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:42:00 UTC +00:00, "post_id"=>25}, {"id"=>95, "title"=>"Acetic Arts", "body"=>"So what is acetic acid? A cursory examination would immediately reveal that a solution of acetic acid is colorless and has that unmistakable and pungent distilled-vinegar scent and sour taste. Producing it is a two-step process. First, a carbohydrate-rich organic material, like grapes, is fermented to make an alcoholic product, like wine. It's then fed extra oxygen to create an environment that is perfect for the acetobacter bacteria to move in and consumer the alcohol and produce acetic acid as a byproduct. I often explain it to kids like this: the poop of yeast is alcohol, and then acetobacter eats that alcoholic poop and poops out acetic acid. Gross, but true.\nIf your goal is to make wine, you don't want acetobacter around, since it risks turning your wine to vinegar, and there's not much fun in toasting an anniversary with glasses of that. But if your goal is to make vinegar, then you'd deliberately introduce acetobacter to your fermenting wine. The modern method is to oxygenate huge vats of acetobacter-inoculated young wine as it's fermenting to produce a final mixture that is between 15 to 20% acetic acid. That mixture is then diluted with water to reach a 5% acidity. So your jug of distilled white vinegar is 95% water and 5% acetic acid, with a pH measurement of approximately 2.4.\nVinegar can be made from any alcoholic beverage. Wine vinegar is made from wine (fermented grapes), while cider vinegar comes from hard cider (fermented apple juice). White distilled vinegar comes from a grain or potato mash and balsamic vinegar is made from aged, fermented grape must (the leftover solids from the winemaking process). Most vinegars have a 5% acidity, but some specialty and flavored vinegars are mixed with a higher proportion of water for an acidity of 4%. This can be problematic for food preservation because our goal is to raise the overall acidity of our food, and a lower-strength vinegar may not give us the oomph we need. In any pickling recipe worth its salt (or should that be vinegar?), it will specifically tell you to use vinegar that has a 5% acidity. You may have never noticed it before, but every bottle or jug of vinegar will have its acidity percentage printed on the label in small print.\n", "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:42:00 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:42:02 UTC +00:00, "post_id"=>25}, {"id"=>96, "title"=>nil, "body"=>"In this series on the science of food preservation, we've thus far discussed the chemistry of preservation, namely, the reduction of water activity and the power of acidification.\nSure, I've tossed around the word \"canning\" in those articles, but I haven't really explained it. Well, here we go, friends. The most powerful tool in your preservation toolbox, the one that gives you the ability to defy the known limits of physics:* water-bath or pressure canning. Even if, like me, you just squeaked by in Mr. Klabunde's junior-year physics class, I promise, the power of temperature and pressure is at your fingertips.\nAll preservation techniques are, in scientific parlance, \"hurdle technologies,\" which refers to the barriers we can erect to prevent microbial growth in our foods. The more hurdles a microbe has to clear in order to survive, the less likely it is that any microbes will.\nThe first two hurdles we looked at in this series—reducing water activity and raising acidity—are chemical ones. Adding the physical hurdle of high temperature allows us to extend the usefulness of our foods even further. Something that's pickled will last for a few months, but when you combine pickling with the high heat of the canning process, that period of time jumps up to 18 months. In fact, heat can be so effective that, depending on what method of canning you've used, it can work even if you don't erect those chemical hurdles, like acidification.\nIn order to survive and thrive, most microbes need a handful of things: food, water, oxygen, and an environment that's in a hospitable temperature and pH range. Canning methods perform a couple of specific tasks. First, they raise the internal temperature of the contents of a jar, killing microbes in the process. Second, they force out air and gases from the jar, which creates a vacuum that causes the lid to seal tight, preventing air from getting back in. This deprives those microbes of the air they need to survive. (There's one important exception to this: the notorious anaerobic bacteria, which thrive in oxygen-free environments. We'll get to that in a bit.)\nThe tools used for canning, including immersive boiling-water baths, atmospheric-steam canners, and pressure canners, all do the same basic thing, but with differences in degree and effectiveness. A pressure canner is like a sledgehammer, while boiling-water and atmospheric-steam canners are more like teeny-tiny tack hammers.

As Amy Besa and Romy Dorotan write in Memories of Philippine Kitchens: Stories and Recipes From Far and Near, popular Filipino dishes, like adobo, lumpia (often cursorily described as Filipino spring rolls), and pancit (a noodle dish—also a cursory description that does not do it justice), represent the cuisine \"at its most accessible to the non-Filipino palate.\"\nSimilarly, Nicole Ponseca writes of adobo in I Am a Filipino: And This Is How We Cook, \"Who can resist the addictively sour, salty, garlicky classic adobo, which seemed to be the friendly bridge for many to connect with Filipinos?\" When my family moved to the Philippines in 1984, chicken adobo was an easy sell for my (white) American father, who, like all (white) American expats, preferred local dishes when they were made with chicken. For my Japanese mother, it was appealing because, well, soy sauce. Reductive-but-totally-accurate stereotypes aside, the dish was a hit, and it's been in the Spaeth household repertoire ever since.\nMy parents' recipe stayed pretty much the same over the years, and it was as simple as can be: Water, soy sauce, and vinegar were combined in a pot, along with some brown sugar, an enormous amount of garlic, whole black peppercorns, and several dried, dusty shards of bay leaf. Chicken legs, thighs, and wings were added to the pot, and the whole thing was simmered for about 45 minutes.\nAfter that, everything got refrigerated for dinner the next day, when the reheated adobo would be served with a big pile of super-garlicky and slightly oily fried rice—the greasiness of the rice tempers both the salinity and the acidity of the adobo sauce.\nSince leaving my parents' home, I've tinkered with their adobo recipe in small ways, and settled on a ratio of soy sauce to vinegar to water that my wife, my child, and I all prefer. I also ditched the brown sugar ages ago, because what I like best about adobo is its bracing, in-your-face quality, and I add more whole peppercorns, because I really enjoy chewing on them after they've been softened by the braise. Finally, I use fresh bay leaves instead of the dried stuff, and I always, always let it sit at least overnight in the fridge.\nGiven that the recipe I'll share with you has gone through decades of small changes, and has been passed down, now, through two generations (from Erlinda to my parents, and from my parents to me), I believe this recipe is, at the very least, authentic in spirit, if not authentic in fact, seeing as it's been devised by non-Filipino hands. I can say without reservation that it is a fine recipe for chicken adobo, although certainly not the best.\n", "created_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:36:58 UTC +00:00, "updated_at"=>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:37:06 UTC +00:00, "post_id"=>1}, {"id"=>3, "title"=>"Testing Browning", "body"=>"This site being what it is, I couldn't just write up the way I make chicken adobo. For one thing, I generally eyeball quantities and use my taste to guide me; for another, I make it differently almost every time, because adobo gives you options.\nSome days, I'd decide to make adobo because I was butchering a chicken for its breasts—making chicken piccata, say—and I had no plans for the legs. In that case, I'd split the legs into drums and thighs and dump them, along with the wings, in a pot with all the adobo elements, then simmer everything until the chicken was cooked. This makes a fine adobo, which I will eat happily every time, but even the most novice cook would be able to point out areas for improvement.\nOn other days, I'd take my time with the adobo, salting the chicken in advance, browning it thoroughly, and blooming the sliced garlic, whole peppercorns, and bay leaves in the rendered chicken fat. Then I'd use the braising liquid to deglaze the fond on the bottom of the pot, add back the browned chicken, and, again, simmer it until the chicken was done.\nAnd then there were days when, if the urge struck me, I'd take the chicken out of the braising liquid (doesn't matter which version, the browned or the un-browned); dry it off; and slide it under a broiler until the skin was a little charred and the meat was warmed through. I'd eat the chicken just like that, or serve it with garlic fried rice and a pool of the braising liquid as a sauce.\nI ended up testing all of these methods side by side. I made batches of chicken adobo in which the chicken pieces were never browned at any point. I made batches in which the garlic and spices were never bloomed in oil, and batches in which they were. I made batches in which the chicken was browned twice, both in the pot and under the broiler at the end. Based on all this, I can say with some confidence that chicken adobo any which way is delicious, and the method you choose has as much to do with personal preference as it does with how much time you have on your hands.\nI do want to take a moment to highlight what I think is the best part of chicken adobo, no matter how it's been cooked: the skin. Even if the chicken is un-browned when it goes in the pot, once it comes out, the skin is my favorite part. But I understand that many people in the US find the prospect of eating floppy braised chicken skin particularly unappealing.\nf you, like me, actually like to eat chicken skin that's easier to slurp than to chew, I can wholeheartedly recommend going with the no-browning route. If you find that unappetizing, you'll have better success if you brown the chicken skin thoroughly first.

Up until last year, I used distilled cane vinegar produced by the brand Datu Puti, which is owned by Philippine food company NutriAsia, but I stopped after reading news reports about the company's shoddy labor practices, which inspired a sustained strike by some of the company's workers in 2018. Since NutriAsia also owns the other major brand of distilled cane vinegar in the Philippines, Silver Swan, I decided to start using rice vinegar instead.\nIn developing this recipe, I tested it using a variety of vinegars: Heinz distilled white vinegar, Japanese rice vinegar (Mizkan), Bragg apple cider vinegar, and both Datu Puti and Silver Swan, tasting all of them side by side. Surprisingly, the only one I found a little odd was the batch made with apple cider vinegar; the rest tasted fine to me, although I preferred the Datu Puti and rice vinegar batches.\nBesa and Dorotan observe that they know of people who use balsamic vinegar in their adobo, and others who use coconut vinegar, and still others who use fruit vinegars of a wide variety.

How do we reconcile that with the tests Kenji did in 2016?\nThe most relevant bit of Kenji's test was how the overnight resting affected chili:\n\tThe only case in which there was a noticeable difference was with the chili, where\n\tthe older batches were distinctly more rounded and mellow in flavor.

It produces long, pretty, true-green, sawtooth-edged leaves that smell very strongly of, well, cilantro.

First, because culantro is more potent, you'll need to use less of it. Second, it's suitable for long-cooked dishes in which cilantro would impart bitterness or lose its more delicate flavor.\nEnrique Awe, chef at the Running W Steakhouse & Restaurant in San Ignacio, Belize, uses culantro in beef and chicken soups, rice and beans, and stewed beans. \"It offers a very nice, herby, citrusy taste,\" he says. \"Also, the flavor blends very well with coconut milk.\" He recommends tearing or cutting the leaves before adding them to stews to release better flavor.\nIllyanna Maisonet, who writes the Cocina Boricua column for the San Francisco Chronicle (making her the first Puerto Rican food columnist in the country), notes that culantro is an essential ingredient in Puerto Rican recaíto, a kind of sofrito that includes no tomato and forms the base for many Puerto Rican dishes.

Turns out that kombu is packed with glutamic acid. It was Ikeda who coined the term umami, which roughly translates as \"savory,\" to describe the taste of glutamic acid (and other similar amino acids). Until that point, scientists had only discovered the other four flavors sensed by the tongue and soft palate: salty, sweet, sour, and bitter.\nBy 1909, pure crystalline MSG extracted from the abundant kelp in the sea around Japan was being sold under the brand name Aji-no-moto (roughly, \"element of flavor\"). The company exists to this day, though with the current high demand for MSG, the chemical is synthesized rather than extracted.

What we do know: Roasted foods take on new and increasingly delicious flavors as proteins and sugars react, combine, and recombine to form a vast array of new flavor and aroma molecules. Coffee without the roasting is simply not delicious.\nWhen coffee is roasted, though, something else forms within the bean: CO2, good old carbon dioxide. The gas resides in the bean, but leaches out over time, until the roasted coffee eventually goes stale. This degassing process happens naturally, all on its own, as soon as the beans are finished roasting. But it takes a while for most of the CO2 to fully vacate the beans, and so, assuming your coffee is relatively fresh—less than a week or two old—there'll still be some CO2 left to come out when you brew it.\nAs soon as the hot water hits the ground coffee, that pent-up carbon dioxide comes rushing out in a degassing whirlwind. (When are those beans going to learn some manners?) You can see this in real time. In a pourover drip cone, the coffee grounds foam and swell, puffing and bubbling until they finally settle down, after 30 seconds to a minute or so. In a French press, you'll see the grounds form a foamy raft on top of the hot water and then just float there, buoyed by the gas, until you stir them back down into the drink. Of course, because the beans degas on their own even in their storage bag, the older the beans get, the less CO2 they have left, making the bloom a less dramatic event.
